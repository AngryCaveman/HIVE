FIELD THEORIES ON CANONICAL AND LIE-ALGEBRA NONCOMMUTATIVE SPACETIMES,"Field theories on canonical noncommutative spacetimes, which are being studied also in connection with string theory, and on k-Minkowski spacetime, which is a popular example of Lie-algebra noncommutative spacetime, can be naturally constructed by introducing a suitable generating functional for Green functions in energy-momentum space. Direct reference to a star product is not necessary. It is sufficient to make use of the simple properties that the Fourier transform preserves in these spacetimes and establish the rules for products of wave exponentials that are dictated by the non-commutativity of the coordinates. The approach also provides an elementary description of “planar” and “non-planar” Feynman diagrams. We also comment on the rich phenomenology emerging from the analysis of these theories.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0027,[]

THE TWISTOR APPROACH TO SPACE-TIME STRUCTURES,"An outline of twistor theory is presented. Initial motivations (from 1963) are given for this type of non-local geometry, as an intended scheme for unifying quantum theory and space-time structure. Basic twistor geometry and algebra is exhibited, and it is shown that this provides a complex-manifold description of classical (spinning) massless particles. Simple quantum commutation rules lead to a concise representation of massless particle wavefunctions, in terms of contour integrals or (more profoundly) holomorphic 1st cohomology. Non-linear versions give elegant representations of anti-self-dual Einstein (or Yang-Mills) fields, describing left-handed non-linear gravitons (or Yang-Mills particles). A brief outline of the current status of the ‘googly problem’ is provided, whereby the right-handed particles would also be incorporated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0017,[]

QUANTUM GEOMETRY AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS,"The goal of this article is to present a broad perspective on loop quantum gravity, a non-perturbative, background independent approach to the problem of unification of general relativity and quantum physics, based on a specific theory of quantum Riemannian geometry. The chapter is addressed to non-experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on underlying ideas, conceptual issues and the overall status of the program rather than mathematical details and associated technical subtleties. This review complements that by Martin Bojowald which focusses on applications of quantum geometry to cosmology.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0013,[]
LOOP QUANTUM COSMOLOGY,"The expansion of our universe, when followed backward in time, implies that it emerged from a phase of huge density, the big bang. These stages are so extreme that classical general relativity combined with matter theories is not able to describe them properly, and one has to refer to quantum gravity. A complete quantization of gravity has not yet been developed, but there are many results about key properties to be expected. When applied to cosmology, a consistent picture of the early universe arises which is free of the classical pathologies and has implications for the generation of structure which are potentially observable in the near future.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0014,[]
SPACE TIME IN STRING THEORY,"This paper explores the holographic description of space-time in string theory. Super-Poincare invariant versions of the theory are described by moduli spaces of S-matrices. The parameters describing the S-matrix have geometrical interpretations in extreme regions of the moduli space, but the S-matrix interpolates smoothly between compact spaces of radically different topology. Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter universes are defined by quantum field theories living on the conformal boundary of AdS space. The geometry of compact factors in the space-time is encoded in internal degrees of freedom of the field theory. The cosmological constant is a discrete input parameter determining the high energy behavior of the system. Later sections discuss the description of stable or unstable de Sitter space-times, and the associated question of the breaking of Supersymmetry, as well as a conjectural holographic theory of quantum space-time geometry.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0012,[]
SPACETIME IN SEMICLASSICAL GRAVITY,"This article will summarize selected aspects of the semiclassical theory of gravity, which involves a classical gravitational field coupled to quantum matter fields. Among the issues which will be discussed are the role of quantum effects in black hole physics and in cosmology, the effects of quantum violations of the classical energy conditions, and inequalities which constrain the extent of such violations. We will also examine the first steps beyond semiclassical gravity, when the effects of spacetime geometry fluctuations start to appear.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0011,[]
Beyond Einstein: Unifying General Relativity with Quantum Physics,"…a really new field of experience will always lead to crystallization of a new system of scientific concepts and laws…when faced with essentially new intellectual challenges, we continually follow the example of Columbus who possessed the courage to leave the known world in almost the insane hope of finding land again beyond the sea.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_others03,[]
RELATIVITY IN THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM,"The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses accurate, stable atomic clocks in satellites and on the ground to provide world-wide position and time determination. These clocks have gravitational and motional frequency shifts which are so large that, without carefully accounting for numerous relativistic effects, the system would not work. This article discusses the conceptual basis, founded on special and general relativity, for navigation using GPS. Relativistic principles and effects of practical importance include the constancy of the speed of light, the equivalence principle, the Sagnac effect, time dilation, gravitational frequency shifts, and relativity of synchronization. Experimental tests of relativity obtained with a GPS receiver aboard the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite will be discussed. Recently frequency jumps arising from satellite orbit adjustments have been identified as relativistic effects.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0010,[]
WAS EINSTEIN RIGHT?: TESTING RELATIVITY AT THE CENTENARY,"We review the experimental evidence for Einstein's special and general relativity. A variety of high precision null experiments verify the weak equivalence principle and local Lorentz invariance, while gravitational redshift and other clock experiments support local position invariance. Together these results confirm the Einstein Equivalence Principle which underlies the concept that gravitation is synonymous with spacetime geometry, and must be described by a metric theory. Solar system experiments that test the weak-field, post-Newtonian limit of metric theories strongly favor general relativity. The Binary Pulsar provides tests of gravitational-wave damping and of strong-field general relativity. Recently discovered binary pulsar systems may provide additional tests. Future and ongoing experiments, such as the Gravity Probe B Gyroscope Experiment, satellite tests of the Equivalence principle, and tests of gravity at short distance to look for extra spatial dimensions could constrain extensions of general relativity. Laser interferometric gravitational-wave observatories on Earth and in space may provide new tests of gravitational theory via detailed measurements of the properties of gravitational waves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0008,[]
UNDERSTANDING OUR UNIVERSE: CURRENT STATUS AND OPEN ISSUES,"Last couple of decades have been the golden age for cosmology.

Several aspects of these developments are critically reviewed, concentrating on conceptual issues and open questions.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0007,[]
PROBING SPACE-TIME THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS,Einstein's equations describe gravity using an elegant but complicated set of equations. Finding astrophysically relevant solutions to these equations requires the most sophisticated numerical algorithms and powerful supercomputers available. The search for astrophysical solutions has made numerical relativity one of the most active areas of research in gravitational physics. Of particular interest in numerical relativity has been simulating the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries involving black holes and neutrons stars. The outcome from these simulations will bring general relativity into harmony with the observations of gravitational radiation that are expected to take place in the immediate future. This article highlights current progress in numerical relativity. It also attempts to envision the future of this field and its integration with gravitational wave astronomy.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0006,[]

THE NATURE OF SPACETIME SINGULARITIES,Present knowledge about the nature of spacetime singularities in the context of classical general relativity is surveyed. The status of the BKL picture of cosmological singularities and its relevance to the cosmic censorship hypothesis are discussed. It is shown how insights on cosmic censorship also arise in connection with the idea of weak null singularities inside black holes. Other topics covered include matter singularities and critical collapse. Remarks are made on possible future directions in research on spacetime singularities.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0003,[]

"DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTS OF SPACE, TIME AND SPACE-TIME FROM NEWTON TO EINSTEIN","The concept of physical change brings together the concepts of space and time. The evolution of the latter two concepts, and of relation between them, in physical theories from Newtonian mechanics to general relativity is outlined, culminating in the development of the concept of space-time and its dynamization. The chrono-geometrical and inertio-gravitational space-time structures are defined, and the compatibility relations between the two are discussed. The philosophical debate between absolute and relational concepts of space and then of space-time is reviewed, as is the contrast between pre-general-relativistic theories with fixed background space-time structures and background-free general relativistic theories. Some implications of this contrast for the problem of quantum gravity are indicated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0001,[]

The interactions and structure of exotic nuclei close to the drip lines have been studied extensively worldwide, and it has been revealed that unstable nuclei, having weakly bound nucleons, exhibit characteristic features such as a halo structure and a soft dipole excitation. We here review the developments of the physics of unstable nuclei in the past few decades.

High Energy Nuclear Physics: From Bear Mountain to the LHC,"I review the development of high energy nuclear physics, in particular the attempts to make new forms of matter in hadronic collisions. I begin with early experimental work done at the Bevelac, the AGS and the SPS. Early theoretical work concentrated on understanding properties of quark and gluonic matter at high temperature and density, the Quark Gluon Plama (QGP), particularly using the methods of lattice gauge theory. Recent theoretical work has involved attempts to more quantitatively describe data coming from experiments at RHIC and LHC. In addition, new forms of matter have been proposed to describe the early times in hadronic collisions. The Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is the high density gluonic matter that initially composes colliding high energy nuclei. The Glasma is highly coherent color electric and color magnetic fields radiating gluons that eventually thermalize. Methods derivative of strongly interacting gauge theory (AdSCFT Correspondence) have been employed to qualitatively understand finite temperature QCD when the intrinsic strength of interactions is strong. The RHIC and LHC experiments provide compelling experimental data to establish that the matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy is a strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP). To what degree, in my opinion, the sQGP is a thermally equilibrated Quark Gluon Plasma, or a Glasma is not yet determined…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0007,[]
Parity- and Time-Reversal Tests in Nuclear Physics,"Nuclear physics tests of parity- and time-reversal invariance have both shaped the development of the Standard Model and provided key tests of its predictions.

PHYSICS WITH LARGE EXTRA DIMENSIONS,"A theory with such a mathematical beauty cannot be wrong: this was one of the main arguments in favor of string theory, which unifies all known physical theories of fundamental interactions in a single coherent description of the universe. But no one has ever observed strings, not even indirectly, neither the space of extra dimensions where they live. However, there is a hope that the “hidden” dimensions of string theory are much larger than what we thought in the past and they become within experimental reach in the near future, together with the strings themselves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0025,[]
OPEN-STRING MODELS WITH BROKEN SUPERSYMMETRY,"I review the salient features of three classes of open-string models with broken supersymmetry. These suffice to exhibit, in relatively simple settings, the two phenomena of “brane supersymmetry” and “brane supersymmetry breaking”. In the first class of models, to lowest order supersymmetry is broken both in the closed and in the open sectors. In the second class of models, to lowest order supersymmetry is broken in the closed sector, but is ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0024,[]
SPIN FOAMS AS FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS,"It has been recently shown that a certain non-topological spin foam model can be obtained from the Feynman expansion of a field theory over a group. The field theory defines a natural “sum over triangulations”, which removes the cut off on the number of degrees of freedom and restores full covariance. The resulting formulation is completely background independent: spacetime emerges as a Feynman diagram, as it did in the old two-dimensional matrix models. We show here that ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0023,[]
ON THE ACCURACY OF THE POST-NEWTONIAN APPROXIMATION,"We apply standard post-Newtonian methods in general relativity to locate the innermost circular orbit (ICO) of irrotational and corotational binary black-hole systems. We find that the post-Newtonian series converges well when the two masses are comparable. We argue that the result for the ICO which is predicted by the third post-Newtonian (3PN) approximation is likely to be very close to the “exact” solution, within 1% of fractional accuracy or better. The 3PN result is also in remarkable agreement with a numerical calculation of the ICO in the case of two corotating black holes moving on exactly circular orbits. The behaviour of the post-Newtonian series suggests that the gravitational dynamics of two bodies of comparable masses does not resemble that of a test particle on a Schwarzschild background. This leads us to question the validity of some post-Newtonian resum-mation techniques that are based on the idea that the field generated by two black holes is a deformation of the Schwarzschild space-time.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0022,[]
GAMMA RAY BURSTS: SOME FACTS AND IDEAS,"Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most explosive events after the big bang: their energy output corresponds to a sizeable fraction of a solar mass entirely converted into energy in a few seconds. Although many questions about their progenitors remain to be answered, it is likely that they are generated by a newly formed and fast spinning black hole. The colossal power characterizing GRBs is carried by a surprisingly small amount of matter, which is accelerated to speeds differing from c by one part in ten thousands. GRBs are then the most (special and general) relativistic objects we know of. Since GRBs are the brightest sources at high redshift, albeit for a limited amount of time, they are also the best torchlights we have to shine the far universe.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0021,[]
WHAT CAN WE LEARN ABOUT NEUTRON STARS FROM GRAVITY-WAVE OBSERVATIONS?,"In the next few years, the first detections of gravity-wave signals using Earth-based interferometric detectors will begin to provide precious new information about the structure and dynamics of compact bodies such as neutron stars. The intrinsic weakness of gravity-wave signals requires a proactive approach to modeling the prospective sources and anticipating the shape of the signals that we seek to detect. Full-blown 3-D numerical simulations of the sources are playing and will play an important role in planning the gravity-wave data-analysis effort. I review some recent analytical and numerical work on neutron stars as sources of gravity waves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0020,[]

WHAT GRAVITATIONAL SIGNALS SAY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND THE EVOLUTION OF ASTROPHYSICAL SOURCES,"Gravitational waves transport very detailed information on the structure and evolution of astrophysical sources. For instance a binary system in the early stages of its evolution emits a wavetrain at specific frequencies that depend on the characteristics of the obital motion; as the orbit shrinks and circularize, due to radiation reaction effects, the orbiting bodies get closer and tidally interact. This interaction may result in the excitation of the proper modes of oscillation of the stars, and in the emission of gravitational signals that carry information on the mode frequencies, and consequently on the equation of state in the stellar interior. These phenomena may occur either in solar type stars with orbiting planets and in compact binaries, and in this lecture we will discuss different approaches that can be used to study these processes in the framework of General Relativity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0015,[]

We begin with a brief discussion of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves that are likely to be detected first by the coming in operation laser interferometers, such as GEO, LIGO, VIRGO. Then, we proceed to relic gravitational waves emphasizing their quantum-mechanical origin and the inevitability of their existence. Combining the theory with available observations, we discuss the prospects of direct detection of relic gravitational waves. A considerable part of the paper is devoted to comparison of relic gravitational waves with the density perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin. It is shown how the phenomenon of squeezing of quantum-mechanically generated cosmological perturbations manifests itself in the periodic structures of the metric power spectra and in the oscillatory behaviour of the CMBR multipoles C",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0013,[]

In the current cosmological model, these structures result from acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma.

THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE: FROM ORIGINS TO ITS FUTURE USES,"Einstein's Equivalence Principle, his grand hypothesis that locally united gravity and inertia, and which led the way toward the full theory of general relativity, is still today being subjected to some of the most precision tests in physics. One of the most sensitive ways to find any additional very weak, long range interaction between matter is to search for a non-universality of gravitational free fall rates. And one of the best ways to test whether the space-time arena's geometry is established solely by the metric tensor field or by also other participating (scalar) fields, is to test the universality of free fall among celestial bodies. We continue today a 400 year lineage of such experiments because they still raise fundamental questions about the details of physical law.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0004,[]

After a discussion of the extent to which these features of general relativity can be generalized and extended to any future fundamental theory, a principle of general permutation invariance is proposed and used to evaluate some current attempts to develop a theory of quantum gravity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0002,[]

NONLINEAR WAVES IN THERMOELASTIC SOLIDS UNDERGOING PHASE TRANSITIONS,"This paper is concerned with continuum modeling of the macroscopic dynamical response of one-dimensional thermoelastic bars undergoing phase transitions. The specific model considered involves a particular ""two-well"" Helmholtz free energy potential governing the bulk response of the material as well as a nucleation criterion and kinetic relation controlling the initiation and evolution of the phase transition. Inertia is taken into account, and the discussion is based on an adiabatic theory. In contrast to models in which the free energy involves only a single well, the entropy inequality at propagating strain discontinuities is not sufficient to assure the uniqueness of solutions to the boundary-initial value problems of interest: kinetics and nucleation must be imposed as well.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0012,[]

BLACK-HOLE ACCRETION DISK INSTABILITIES,"The understanding of stellar accretion disks has made revolutionary progress since the standard, steady disk model was proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev in 1973 Observations of the accretion disks in close binaries, especially in black-hole candidates, however, have revealed rather complex behavior, which cannot simply be described by steady-state picture of the standard model. We thus need to modify the standard model so as to explain a variety of observations. We first discuss the thermal limit-cycle instability caused by partial ionization of hydrogen (and helium), which seems to be responsible for X-ray nova eruptions.

In these sources, an accretion disk is considered to extend close to a neutron star or a black hole and to mainly govern the appearance of the X-ray emission. These sources generally show soft and hard spectral states, which possibly correspond to two interchangeable states of the inner part of the accretion disk. On the other hand, the outer part of the disk reflects, reprocesses and sometimes obscures X-rays from the central compact star. Similarities and differences between neutron star and black hole candidate sources are also discussed.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814350976_0011,[]

Our foreign minister, Mr S. Rajaratnam, asked me to return to Kuala Lumpur as high commissioner for three years from 1980. I accepted as I would have to retire from the University the same year, having attained the age of 60. I had many friends in Malaysia and some of the students whom I had taught at the University of Malaya in Singapore before the establishment of a separate university in Kuala Lumpur had reached high positions in the civil service.

Mr Chia believed that as ASEAN was moving ahead, Singapore needed to be effectively represented in all ASEAN capitals. Mr Chia, a friendly and warm personality, was very persuasive but when I discovered that I would be paid less than the joint income of my wife and myself, I declined the offer. I had already served Singapore in India and Malaysia on low pay for four years, supplementing my income by renting out my house. The officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inevitably put the blame for their stinginess on the Ministry of Finance. I called on George Bogaars, the permanent secretary for finance, and discovered that the question of my pay had never been referred to him! When I revealed this to Mr Chia he mumbled his apologies. Soon I was offered more reasonable terms. He suggested that I follow our prime minister who, accompanied by ministers Hon Sui Sen, S.

It is essential to have first-hand information quickly to take countermeasures. What we feared most after 13 May 1969 was the possibility of a great flood of panic-stricken Chinese rushing to Singapore. We had also to be on guard against racial outbreaks on the island.

CLASSICAL POTENTIAL THEORY AND ANALYTIC CAPACITY,"Recently, analytic capacity has been proved to be semi-additive (that is, sub-additive modulo an absolute constant). This solves a long standing open problem in complex analysis using real variables methods. The proof of this remarkable result, which is the culmination of a long series of contributions by many authors, uses some ideas from Potential Theory and, in fact, the problem itself presents a definite formal analogy with some central aspects of Potential Theory. The purpose of this article is to review the basics of Classical Potential Theory in such a way that the formal analogy between analytic capacity and classical Wiener capacity becomes evident and the semi-additivity problem becomes natural. At the end one gives an idea of the main difficulty involved in its solution.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812708441_0010,[]

One of the tools we shall use is the “approximation” of such a space at each point by a linear space…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814583947_0010,[]

In particular, optimal estimates are found for the cone of radially decreasing functions on the minimal Lorentz spaces Λ(X) (restricted type estimates), and a new Banach function space, closely related to Λ(X), is also naturally defined.

The Radon-Nikodým theorem for vector measures and integral representation of operators on Banach function spaces,"A well known vector measure version of the Radon-Nikodým theorem—comparing two vector measures— can also be interpreted in terms of factorization of an operator—the one associated to the first measure— through the one associated to the second one. Using several results published in recent years, we show the factorization version of this Radon-Nikodým theorem and its applications in the setting of the Operator Theory and the Harmonic Analysis.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814699693_0008,[]

The Spring Valley Ranch: Fulfilling a Dream,"Robert had always immensely enjoyed physical activity in the outdoors. When he was a student, his favorite summer job was one where he was out in the wilderness of British Columbia (in Canada), surveying all by himself. When he was in Chicago, he very much enjoyed swimming with Fermi in Lake Michigan. At Los Alamos, he enjoyed hiking with the other physicists, horseback riding with Oppenheimer, and cross-country skiing with Hans Bethe. At Caltech, he played tennis with Harold Brown and other top tennis players there, such as Jack Roberts and Harry Gray; as he approached his 60's was still defeating young men in their 20's. While living in Pasadena with his first family he hiked with his sons Ted and Peter, and took them skiing and on trips to national parks in western U.S. and Canada.

CHIRAL SEPARATION OF PROPRANOLOL HYDROCHLORIDE BY SMB PROCESS INTEGRATED WITH CRYSTALLIZATION,"Resolution of propranolol hydrochloride was studied in self-packed columns of perphenyl carbamoylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). Both bed voidage and linear equilibrium constants were evaluated from a series of linear elution chromatograms by moment analysis. A modified h-root method was used to determine the competitive Langmuir isotherm of propranolol hydrochloride in the nonlinear region. Continuous separation of the target enantiomer from its racemic mixture was studied by Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatography in both linear and nonlinear region. Desired (S)-propranolol hydrochloride was produced in the raffinate product at a high purity. Solubility of propranolol hydrochloride was determined experimentally in methanol at different temperatures. Crystallization of propranolol hydrochloride from different initial composition solutions in the mixed solvent of methanol and acetone was also investigated with different product purity and yield. SMB productivity was further increased at the sacrifice of decreasing product purity. The obtained solution was further purified by crystallization process. Compared with direct crystallization which is only suitable for racemic conglomerate, the integrated process is especially suitable for the majority of chiral drugs which belong to racemic compounds as long as suitable and economic chiral stationary phases (CSPs) are available in the SMB separation.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0020,[]
THE ZLC METHOD FOR DIFFUSION MEASUREMENTS,"The zero length column (ZLC) technique has become a common tool to measure mass transfer kinetics in microporous adsorbents. The partial loading experiment is a variant of the traditional ZLC method in which the adsorbent is not allowed to reach full equilibration with the gas phase. Even though this variant of the ZLC experiment was introduced over 10 years ago, it has been applied only by few researchers. In this contribution we review the basic theory of the partial loading experiment and show that it can be used to establish the contributions of different mass transfer mechanisms. A detailed numerical model that includes the effects of nonlinearity of the isotherm and combined diffusion and surface barrier effects is presented to allow the correlation of complex sorbate-sorbent systems.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0019,[]

DESULFURIZATION OF FUELS BY SELECTIVE ADSORPTION FOR ULTRA-CLEAN FUELS,"Recently, desulfurization for clean-fuel production has gained great interest because of the severe environment regulations and the needs in fuel cell application. The hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process is highly efficient in the desulfurization of liquid fuels. However, it is difficult to use this HDS technology to reduce the sulfur content of liquid fuels to less than 10 ppmw. The new challenge is to use adsorption to selectively remove the sulfur or nitrogen compounds from fossil fuels. There is an ongoing effort to develop new sorbents to remove these compounds in the refinery processes and commercial fuels. In this paper, the desulfurization and denitrogenation by adsorption technology will be reviewed.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0017,[]
OPTIMISATION OF ADSORPTIVE STORAGE: THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION,"The storage of gases in porous adsorbents is examined here thermodynamically from a systems viewpoint, to derive concrete objective criteria to guide the search for the 'Holy Grail' adsorbent, for which the adsorptive delivery is maximized. It is shown that for ambient temperature storage of hydrogen and delivery between 30 bar and 1.5 bar pressure, for the optimum adsorbent the adsorption enthalpy change is 15.1 kJ/mole, while for methane it is 18.8 kJ/mole. For carbons, an optimum operating temperature of about 115 K is predicted for hydrogen storage, while for methane the optimum temperature for carbons is 254 K. It is also demonstrated that for maximum delivery of the gas the optimum adsorbent must be homogeneous. These results are confirmed with the help of experimental data from the literature, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations conducted here using slit pore models of activated carbons and atomistic models of carbon nanotubes.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0016,[]
EQUILIBRIUM THEORY-BASED DESIGN OF SMBS FOR A GENERALIZED LANGMUIR ISOTHERM,"This work presents design criteria for complete separation of binary mixtures in Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) separations that apply to systems, whose retention behavior is characterized by a generalized Langmuir isotherm. By allowing for negative terms in the denominator of the classical Langmuir isotherm, this newly introduced adsorption model covers a broad class of adsorption isotherms, including Langmuir or anti-Langmuir behavior for both adsorbates, and mixed cases where one species behaves in a Lagmuirian and the other in an anti-Langmuirian manner. By extending classical equilibrium theory results for the binary Langmuir isotherm, and by generalizing the approach followed earlier to derive SMB design criteria for the binary and multi-component Langmuir isotherm, exact algebraic equations for the boundary of the complete separation region in the operating parameter space are derived for all possible generalized Langmuir isotherm.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0014,[]

A unit cell that contains at least 3 × 3 array of square channels divided by thin walls of single atom thickness was developed. The simulations clarified that the LJ-methane in graphene walls with the effective channel size of ca. 4σ exhibited extremely elevated freezing points. The significant elevation was considered to be brought not only by superimposed potential from walls, but also partly by the interaction between fluid molecules existing in different compartments through the ultrathin walls. Besides these factors, results of simulations with walls made up with fluid molecules themselves indicated possibility of additional enhancing factor for freezing that was not prevailing in slit-pore case.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0013,[]

It is shown that the co-condensation synthesis is suitable to introduce a relatively high concentration of functional ligands on the surface of channel-like mesostructures without losing their ordering, as confirmed by elemental analysis and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms and pore size analysis demonstrated that the resulting mesoporous organosilicas are of high surface area, large pore volume and pore diameter in the range of 8-9 nm.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0011,[]
ADSORPTION STUDIES OF CAGE-LIKE AND CHANNEL-LIKE ORDERED MESOPOROUS ORGANOSILICAS WITH VINYL AND MERCAPTOPROPYL SURFACE GROUPS,"Ordered mesoporous cage-like silicas, FDU-1, with pendant vinyl and mercaptopropyl groups were synthesized via direct co-condensation of triethoxyvinylsilane with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane with TEOS. Moreover, vinyl-modified FDU-1 was prepared via post-synthesis modification of FDU-1 with triethoxyvinylsilane. For comparison, ordered mesoporous channel-like silica, SBA-15, with mercaptopropyl groups was synthesized by using both aforementioned methods. Nitrogen and argon adsorption-desorption isotherms provided evidence that short ligands such as vinyl can be easily incorporated to cage-like pores by both methods. The resulting materials possessed narrow pore size distributions (PSDs) and uniform openings of cage-like pores. In the case of FDU-1 with mercaptopropyl groups, argon adsorption indicated narrow PSD, whereas desorption showed nonuniformity of the pore entrance sizes. Furthermore, for the latter materials the removal of polymeric template was much more difficult.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0010,[]

STRUCTURAL MODELING OF POROUS CARBONS USING A HYBRID REVERSE MONTE CARLO METHOD,"We present molecular models for 3 saccharose based carbons of different densities obtained using a Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) protocol which incorporates an energy constraint. The radial distribution functions of the simulated models are in good agreement with experiment. Moreover, 3 and 4 member carbon rings, reported in the literature for many modeling studies of carbon, are absent or extremely rare in our final structural models. These small member rings are high energy structures and are believed to be an artifact of the usual RMC method. The presence of the energy penalty term in our simulation protocol penalizes the formation of these structures. Using a ring connectivity analysis method that we developed, we find that these atomistic models of carbons are made up of defective graphene segments twisted in a complex way. These graphene segments are largely made up of 6 carbon member rings, but also contain some 5 and 7 carbon member rings. We also found that in addition to the graphene segments there are some carbon chains which do not belong to any graphene segments. To characterize our models, we calculated the geometric pore size distribution and also simulated the adsorption of argon at 77.4 K in the models using GCMC simulations. The adsorption isotherm obtained for all three models are representative of microporous carbons.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812770264_0007,[]
SUPERCRITICAL ADSORPTION MECHANISM AND ITS IMPACT TO APPLICATION STUDIES,"Hydrogen storage and methane capture receive the worldwide attention due to their importance in sustainable energy and environment protection. Adsorption provides an efficient way to compress gases, therefore, has been applied for the development of hydrogen storage technology. It also provides an efficient way to separate gas mixtures, therefore, is being studied for the capture of methane from its mixture with air in order to avoid methane emission. However, both hydrogen and methane are supercritical gases at the temperature of engineering interest and follow a different mechanism of adsorption compared to that of sub-critical gases. The present work shows why only monolayer coverage mechanism functions at above-critical temperatures. Pros and cons to this point of view are presented. This understanding of the adsorption mechanism is essential for the research of hydrogen storage since the mechanism claims that any storage method based on adsorption will not satisfy the commercial requirement for hydrogen storage no matter how novel the material is. On the other hand, understanding the adsorption mechanism may help to follow a successful route in the research.

PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ADSORPTION STUDIES OF THE METAL CATALYSTS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE REFORMING WITH METHANE,"The effects of active components, promoters, and reforming reaction on structure variation of catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming with methane are extensively investigated. It is found that the active component and promoters disperse in different sites on the support. The obvious decrease of the mean micropore size of the samples indicates that the impregnated metal species maybe mainly locate on the inner surface of the micropore of the support and that the reforming active sites also locate in these micropore metal sites. It is also interesting to note that the pore distribution and surface areas of the samples vary after the reforming reaction. The addition of the alkaline oxide promoter prohibits the metal dispersion on the support and inappropriate addition amount of the promoters can result in sharp decrease of the metal dispersion.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0133,[]
THE CONTROL OF THE VACUUM SWING ADSORPTION PROCESS FOR AIR SEPARATION,"Control of pressure and vacuum swing adsorption systems is challenging due to the unsteady state nature of the processes and the high degree of system non-linearity. System purity, flow rates and pressure must be regulated to within small tolerances to ensure compliance with customer requirements. Traditionally, industry has applied multiple, individual PID controllers to pressure swing plants to provide the required control. However, control problems in the field have arisen due to the fact that the plants operate in a batch-like manner and are highly non-linear resulting in PID loop interaction and instability. This paper describes the experimental operation of the oxygen VSA process, with the PID scheme implemented on a pilot scale VSA plant and shows the open and closed-loop response of system purity, flow rate and process pressures to changes in external and internal disturbances. Limitations of the PID scheme are highlighted.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0132,[]

The result indicated that the iron cations play a role in zeolite structural damage by bonding with the zeolite framework. The iron oxide partly dispersed on the external surface of zeolite-Y can be removed by dissolution using EDTA as a media/solvent, and so the remaining iron is assigned to be encapsulated inside the zeolite.

THE PORE STRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIAN BROWN AND SWELLING AND NON SWELLING BITUMINOUS COALS AND ITS EFFECT ON REACTIVITY UNDER REGIME I AND REGIME D COMBUSTION CONDITIONS,"The structure of coal char and its development during combustion has been a key interest among workers in this area. In particular the importance of the role of the pore structure relative the chemical reactivity on the observed rates. This paper reports on the pore development of three Australian coal chars with combustion under high (Regime II) conditions. The chars were prepared from a swelling low volatile bituminous coal (Norwich Park), a non-swelling low volatile bituminous coal (Collinsville) and a brown coal (Loy-Yang). The variation in the reactivity of these three Australian coal chars has been estimated in a fixed bed under Regime I conditions. The effect of the pore structure and development on the global reactivity of the chars burnt under Regime II conditions were examined. The results suggest a significant role of pore structure in determining the observed global rates of chars under Regime II conditions.

It is shown that excess internal energy and entropy are negative due to rearrangement of molecules in non-uniform adsorption field. The excess Helmholtz free energy is positive at low loading of a micropore and becomes negative near to saturation limit. The negative departure from Raoult's law in the adsorption phase behavior is proved to be caused by decreasing of the excess Helmholtz free energy with increasing of total number of molecules in a micropore rather than its negative value.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0123,[]

EQUILIBRIUM ADSORPTION OF SINGLE AND BINARY COMPONENTS OF PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION ONTO ACTIVATED NATURAL ZEOLITE,"Experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption behavior of phenolic compounds, namely phenol and chlorophenol, onto activated natural zeolite. Adsorption of both compounds is studied in a binary component system and the results are compared with that of single component. The experiment was conducted in equilibrium batch system at various temperature and various ratio of solution to solid. Competition effect was studied by adding a certain volume of aqueous solution containing certain concentrations of phenol and para chloro phenol (PCP) (1:1) into certain amount of zeolite. The mixture was then agitated and kept at certain temperature. It is indicated that adsorption capacity of zeolite for phenol at binary component system is much lower than that at single component system. This is in contrast to the capacity for PCP, which shows higher at binary component system. Adsorption capacity for phenol and PCP at binary component system increases by increasing the temperature (30-40°C). It is indicated that chlorophenol was the preference compound to be adsorbed compared with phenol.

SPECTROSCOPIC STUDY ON THE ADSORPTION OF AMMONIA IN A SERIES OF ALKALI-EXCHANGED FAUJASITE ZEOLITES,"The basic properties of a series of cationic zeolites have been investigated by means of FTIR and TPD coupled with mass spectrometer techniques using ammonia as probe molecule. Our TPD results demonstrate clearly that the adsorption strength of ammonia on these cationic zeolites is strongly dependent on the Lewis acidity of counter-ions, indicating that the interaction between ammonia and cationic zeolites is dominated by an electrostatic interaction between counter-ions and the lone electron pair on nitrogen atoms. However, the variation of the shift value in wavenumber of vibration bands of ammonia adsorbed on different cationic zeolites revealed by FTIR can not be explained only by this electrostatic interaction. The existence of a supplementary interaction between the negatively charged oxygen atoms of framework with the hydrogen atoms of ammonia is postulated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0115,[]
SMALL ANGLE X-RAY AND ULTRA SMALL ANGLE X-RAY SCATTERING FROM SOME FRACTAL POROUS SOLIDS - THEORY AND EXPERIMENT,"Small angle scattering from a range of porous solids including coal, processed coal, glassy carbon, charcoal and porous catalyst supports indicates that the surfaces of the pore walls in these solids are not smooth i.e. that Porod's law is not obeyed. However, the small angle scattering curves for both X-rays and neutrons for many systems still obeys a simple power law dependence with scattering angle, as in Porod's law, but with a power law index α not equal to 4. Depending on the value of a this scattering behaviour may be interpreted as arising from different effects. Some porous solids have walls whose surfaces are fractaly rough i.e. exhibit self-similar surface structures, whilst some exhibit behaviour characteristic of mass fractals. Other systems, however, have been described as having pore walls which are not sharp i.e. possess fuzzy interfaces.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0114,[]
ON THE THERMODYNAMIC STABILITY OF ADSORBED FILMS AND CAPILLARY CONDENSATION BY MOLECULAR SIMULATION,The structure of the interface formed by capillary condensation of a gas in a pore was investigated by means of the Grand Canonical Ensemble Monte Carlo method. The pore was represented by parallel plates in the z direction of the Monte Carlo cell but the adsorbate-wall interaction was truncated in the x direction to create a finite pore in order to facilitate the formation of an interface parallel to the wall-adsorbate surface. It is shown that at a low gas pressure the adsorbate consisted of essentially two high density layers adsorbed on each wall with the region in the middle of the cell consisting of bulk gas. By contrast at a higher gas pressure the gas condenses to form three adsorbed layers and a region of essentially bulk liquid in equilibrium with the gas in the cell centre with a well defined and stable liquid/gas interface.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0113,[]

EFFECTS OF ADSORPTION KINETICS ON SIMULATED MOVING BED PERFORMANCE,"This work shows a detailed dynamic model for a simulated moving bed (SMB), which takes into account non-instantaneous equilibrium at the solid-fluid interface. The theoretical model represents “n” fixed beds connected in a circuit with periodic shifting of boundary conditions. This corresponds to the advancement, from time to time, of the inlet (feed and eluent) and outlet (raffinate and extract) streams one bed ahead in the direction of fluid flow. The cases studied involved few columns per section, which is a typical case in many selective adsorbents with small particle size (<300 μm). Cases of instantaneous solid-fluid equilibrium were compared with those including increasing resistances to equilibrium attainment and different performance parameters were obtained. Experimental results for SMB separation of a chiral epoxide with cellulose triacetate (CTA) were well correlated with the proposed model using modified Langmuir isotherms.

NOVEL METHOD TO REMOVE LIGHT IONIC SUBSTANCES BY ACTIVATED CARBON ELECTRODE,"The concept of the electric double layer capacitor was applied in order to remove typical ionic substances from water by adsorption on activated carbon, using electrostatic force. Ions are captured on the electrode of the opposite polarity when the direct current (up to 2 volts) is applied, and captured ions are released when electrodes are either short-circuited or discharged. Therefore, by changing the pattern of the power supply, concentration of ions in the outlet stream is changed periodically. Activated carbon fiber was used as an electrode. Typically, municipal water (300μS/cm) was passed at a flow rate of 0.1-3 ml/min/g-carbon. The degree of ion removal increased with increase in the voltage applied and the BET surface area of the activated carbon used, whereas it decreased with increase in the flow rate. In the cyclic operation, typical removal ratio was over 85% and 50-80% of the inlet flow was recovered in the product.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0097,[]

IMPROVEMENT OF MESOPOROSITY OF ACTIVATED CARBONS FROM PET BY NOVEL PRE-TREATMENT FOR STEAM ACTIVATION,"The method of preparing mesoporous activated carbons useful for the adsorption of large molecules is desirable. The development of mesoporosity of activated carbons using catalytic effects of metal compounds has been previously reported. However, a non catalytic activation method which produces pores whose radii range between 2 ∼ 10 nm has not been reported as far as we are aware.

ADSORPTION OF WATER ON ACTIVATED CARBON-AN OVERVIEW,"Among different isotherm equations presented for the adsorption of water vapor by AC, those of Dubinin-Serpinsky (D-S) and Talu-Meunier (T-M) are used to fit 107 sets of experimental data found in literature in an attempt to relate the parameters found in these equations to AC properties. The characteristics of adsorption isotherm and hystersis loop are studied foT different type of AC. The effects of temperature on the shape of adsorption isotherm, as well as the effects of pore structure and adsorption cycling on the hysteresis loop are presented. It was found that the isotherm of water adsorption usually has a hysteresis loop, which occurs at a medium to higher water relative pressure. The width of hysteresis loop depends on the structure of carbon and for carbon with very small micropores the hysteresis loop does no exist. For a given type of AC the hysteresis loop would disappear if it were subjected to successive adsorption-desorption cycles.

Differences in the breakthrough behavior of two different fixed-bed geometries, namely, reverse stratified tapered adsorber (RSTA) and the conventional stratified cylindrical adsorber (SCA) are explained using this approach. The simulations indicate that the RSTA yields longer breakthrough time than the SCA, and the difference in breakthrough times between the two is maximum at low concentrations for the linear isotherm, and decreases as the isotherm becomes more non-linear at higher concentrations. For both the RSTA and SCA, the MTZ sharpens as the isotherm becomes more non-linear.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0083,[]

The results showed that the uptake of phenol and substituted phenols depends on the microporosity of the adsorbent and the hydrophobicity of the adsorbate.

USING LOCAL IAS THEORY AND PORE SIZE DISTRIBUTION CONCEPT TO PREDICT BINARY ADSORPTION KINETICS OF GASES ON ACTIVATED CARBON,"A model is proposed using the Ideal Adsorption Solution Theory (IAST) and micropore size distribution (MPSD) concept to describe the multicomponent adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of gases in activated carbon. In order to overcome the thermodynamic violation, the IAST instead of the extended Langmuir equation is used to calculate the local multicomponent adsorption equilibrium. The micropore size is related to the adsorbate-adsorbent interaction energy by the Lennard-Jones potential. The overall adsorption isotherm and the diffusion flux of the adsorbed species are the integrals of their corresponding local values over all micropore size distribution range accessible by the adsorbate molecules. The size exclusion effect is taken into account in the competition of different sized molecules for a given pore. The model predictions are tested with the adsorption kinetics data of binary gases on Norit activated carbon. The results are better than those predicted by a previously proposed multicomponent adsorption kinetics model also using MPSD concept but with the local multicomponent adsorption isotherm being calculated by the extended Langmuir equation.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812793331_0053,[]
SELECTIVE REMOVAL OF GOLD FROM NATURAL WATERS BY ADSORBING COLLODD FLOTATION,"Adsorbing colloid flotation is a separation technique with distinct advantages for removing trace elements from natural and industrial waters. These advantages are: rapid processing, simple design, small volume of final solution, low residual concentration, flexibility of operation, and moderate cost. In this method, the substance to be removed (e.g. metal ions) is adsorbed on colloidal particles or coprecipitated on a floe produced by the addition of a flocculating agent. A surfactant is then added to adsorb on the particle or floe thus rendering it hydrophobic. The metal-loaded particle is then removed by further adsorption at the surface of rising bubbles in a flotation system. Experiments were carried out by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a cationic surfactant, alone or in combination with thiourea (a complexing agent) for removal of gold. Adding 10 mg/L of thiourea to an equal volume of CTAB instead of CTAB alone, increased the extraction to a dramatic degree. The flotation experiments were conducted at various pH values and air flow rates. Extraction of the gold into the foam layer was strongly dependent on the pH of the feed.

The average iso acid adsorption capacities of the adsorbents in descending order were activated carbon manufactured from wood, coal, peat and coconut. Iso acid adsorption capacity was found to be strongly correlated with increasing pore volume and surface area in the mesoporous region.

These adsorbents have carbonaceous structure, with different surface properties. The isotherms for all three systems were determined by the so-called batch bottle technique. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) electron density at the adsorption site was estimated by CAChE program, because it is suggested that the electron density will affect the adsorption isotherm [4]. A qualitative relationship between Freundlich 1/n and the HOMO density of adsorbent was found by combining the experimental and computational results for modified GAC. The value of Freundlich 1/n for all adsorbent systems including modified GAC was decreasing linearly with an increase in “adsorbent” HOMO density.

It is found that the total permeability is contributed mostly by Knudsen and surface diffusion at very low pressure, while at high pressures where capillary condensation is occurring, the surface diffusion and capillary condensate flow control the total flux through the particle.

All theories in the literature exhibit a surface diffusivity increase with loading, but they all predict a decrease in the surface diffusion permeability, while experimental surface permeability shows an increase.

It has been found that the effect of pH is significant in the sorption of U(VI) onto the both types of granite surfaces. It is noticed that the surface sorption coefficients of U(VI) for the natural fracture surfaces are greater than those of the fresh intact rock surfaces due to the higher content of secondary minerals which acted as stronger sorbents. The kinetic sorption results are fitted with a two-step first-order kinetic sorption model and the results show a good agreement between the experimental results and the model. The desorption results show that the sorption process of U(VI) is a little irreversible for the two types of granite surfaces depending on pH and surface type.

VOC ENRICHMENT BY A VSA PROCESS WITH CARBON BEDS,"A VOC enrichment system incorporating a vacuum desorption of carbon beds was evaluated for an acetone recovery. The adsorbent was regenerated by vacuuming and purging the beds. The pilot plant was composed of two carbon bed filled with Pellet-BG or BPL from Calgon Corp., a liquid-ring vacuum pump, two desiccant beds, and a condensation system. Acetone laden air(12000 ppm) was treated with two carbon beds which emits clean air containing less than 500 ppm of acetone. With this VSA process, acetone enriched to 8%, which means around 6 times as rich as the feed concentration. The enrichment depends highly on adsorption isotherms, especially Henry constant. As many VOCs which show stiff Langmuir-type isotherms on carbons, desorbing acetone from adsorbents by vacuuming and/or purging the beds were not likely to be as effective as heating up the adsorbents in a sense of working capacity. Therefore, vacuum swing adsorption system turns out to be competent in recovering high-vapor-pressure VOCs with a moderate Henry constant on a used adsorbent. A numerical simulation results using Aspen ADSIM were also provided.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704320_0094,[]

From the performance test, the ruggedness, sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor are investigated. From the variation of oscillation frequency of the sensor, it is found that the variation is proportional to the concentration of the organic vapors.

CATALYTIC REDUCTION MECHANISM OF NITRIC OXIDE OVER ACF,"A widely used method for activated carbon fibers (ACFs)/Cu catalyst is nitric oxide reduction, which includes the process involved whenever nitric oxide (adsorbate) is brought into contact with a solid (adsorbent), and then reduced into nitrogen and oxygen. In this work, the catalytic reduction mechanisms of NO over ACFs/Cu prepared by electrolytic copper plating has been studied. It is found that copper content on carbon surfaces increases with increasing the plating time. As an experimental result, nitric oxide is converted into the nitrogen and oxygen on ACFs and ACFs/Cu catalyst surfaces at 500°C. Especially, the surfaces of ACFs/Cu catalyst were found to scavenge the oxygen released by catalytic reduction of NO, which could be explained by the presence of another nitric oxide reduction mechanism between ACFs and ACFs/Cu catalysts.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704320_0088,[]

ADVANCED FLUE GAS TREATMENT BY NOVEL DE-SOX TECHNOLOGY OVER ACTIVE CARBON FIBERS,"It becomes obvious that SOx in flue gas can be removed continuously over active carbon fibers (ACF) subjected to surface treatment such as heat treatment. Pitch based ACF shows highest activity for continuous removing of SOx among several types of ACFs. It is considered that Pitch based ACF can make surface hydrophobic property higher than other types. The flue gas treatment technology using ACF is a semidry oxidative de-SOx process which is effective around temperature of 273-353 K. In addition, this process can produce by-products such as sulfuric acid, and sulfates, and is applicable in the field of flue gas treatment to which the conventional de-SOx technologies could not be applied for economical reasons.

STUDIES ON THE ONE-COLUMN ANALOGUE OF A FOUR-ZONE SMB,"An one-column process was developed to simulate a four-zone SMB using just one column and four storage tanks. The basic principle of this process is identical to a four-zone SMB. A systematic design for one-column process was carried out for the separation of two amino acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan. The process was compared with a four-zone SMB by computer simulation using Aspen Chromatography™. Operating parameters were obtained from the triangle theory. The simulation yielded the product purity of the one-column process to be 92.0% and 85.6% for phenylalanine and tryptophan, respectively, while 92.8% and 87.8% for the four-zone SMB. The recovery yields of the one-column process were 93.0% and 84.0% for phenylalanine and tryptophan, respectively, while 94.0% and 85.5% for the four-zone SMB. The low purity and yield of the one-column process were due to the fact that the concentration profiles are destroyed in the fluid phase after mixing in the collection tanks, but maintained in the solid phase.

USE OF VARIOUS FORMS OF KRAFT LIGNIN FOR TOXIC METAL UPTAKE,"A promising new material to remove toxic metals from polluted waters is kraft lignin, a by-product of paper production produced in large quantities. This material has acidic sites (carboxylic acids, phenolic and enolic hydroxyl groups, and mercapto groups) which can function as an ion exchange sites for metals. One form of kraft pine lignin resulting from an acidification step in paper production is Indulin AT (hereafter called lignin). One practical problem with use of this powder is difficulty in its separation from water after uptake. A more efficient form of lignin was obtained by treating a Ca-loaded lignin power with dimethylformamide (DMF) containing a polysulfone resin. Removal of DMF, which could be re-used, provided a material that could be rolled into cylinders and then flattened into plates or strips. Such strips 1) were structurally stable after suspension in water for six weeks, and 2) maintained efficiency for Pb uptake over eight cycles of uptake followed by extraction of Pb by EDTA. Uptake of Pb and Cd released one mole of Ca for one mole of the metal sorbed. This result clearly shows that the uptake process is one of ion exchange and not simple adsorption in which no species is released on uptake.

In cases of the pure silica and magnesium silicate-impregnated ceramic sheets, the average diameter of the mesopores was 4nm. On the other hand, the aluminum and titanium silicate-impregnated ceramic sheets have the mesopores with average diameter of 5nm and with more wide size distribution. In the aluminum and titanium silicate-impregnated ceramic sheets, the micropores were well developed, compared with the pure silica and magnesium silicate-impregnated ceramic sheets.

In actual homogeneous catalyzed processes, a homogeneous transition-metal catalyst is at equilibrium with its individual components: the free transition-metal center and ligands. Therefore, to apply Reverse Flow Adsorption, a combination of two adsorbents has to be used to reversibly adsorb: the transition-metal center and its ligands. The transition-metal center can be adsorbed by a suitable ligand immobilized onto a solid carrier, while the ligand is adsorbed by an immobilized transition-metal.

IN-SITU CHARACTERIZATION OF ION ADSORPTION AT BIOMIMETIC AIR/WATER INTERFACES,"Biomimetic fatty acid Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface were investigated both by an in-situ near-normal external reflection and by an ex-situ transmission FTIR methods. The monolayers consisted of reactive fatty acids and nonreactive fatty alcohols to cadmium ions, and the relative amount of each component was varied. For the monolayers interacting with pure water showed the composition same for both methods regardless of the amount of reactive acid moieties. However, when the cadmium ions at a concentration of 1mM in the aqueous subphase (pH=5.5) adsorbed to the monolayers, the in-situ method revealed that ion adsorption was significantly less than full coverage relative to available reactive moieties in case of the amount of nonreactive ones exceeding 20%. On the contrary, the ex-situ method showed nearly full coverage of cadmium adsorption regardless of the monolayers’ composition. This discrepancy occurs most probably because the ex-situ analyses requires the sampled monolayers to be neutralized upon drying by an additional adsorption of cadmium ions, which does not reflect the state of the monolayer at the air/water interface. In-situ analyses showed that the adsorption of cadmium ions requiring 2:1 covalent complexation became to be restricted as the nonreactive alcohol molecules neighbored with the reactive sites.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704320_0043,[]

The present study showed that two mechanisms are separated successfully using a stepwise linearization technique incorporated with adsorption diffusion model.

The approach allows us to determine the pore size distribution (PSD) and the adsorbent density without recourse to helium experiments. The PSD obtained with nitrogen at 77.35 K and those obtained with the high-pressure argon, nitrogen and methane are in fair agreement with each other. However in the latter case the PSD shows small pores of about 0.3 nm (physical pore width), which do not appear in the 77.35 K-PSD due to diffusional limitations. It was shown that the adsorption of helium is not negligible at room temperature and it cannot be used as an inert gas to determine the adsorbent density.

DETECTION OF FREEZING POINT ELEVATION IN SLIT NANOSPACE BY ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY,"An experimental trial for finding the freezing point elevation phenomena was conducted, employing the so-called colloidal-probe Atomic Force Microscopy. The elevated freezing point had been predicted in the earlier molecular simulation work by the authors, which is thought to be caused by the attractive potential energy from pore wall. To make up a strongly attractive nanospace, a carbon microparticle was attached to the top of the cantilever tip, and its interaction force with cleaved graphite was measured within a liquid cell filled with organic liquid, controlled at a desired temperature above the bulk freezing point of the liquid. The two surfaces will form a slit-shaped nanospace because the radius of the particle is far larger than the separation distance concerned. For two kinds of liquids, freezing behavior has been detected above the bulk freezing point. Though the extent of the elevation itself was rather small, the finding of the definite existence of the elevation, not only in the micropores but also in a nanospace with the size of a few nanometers, would be of much importance in the research field of the phase behavior in nanopores.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704320_0039,[]

Methyl mercaptan adsorption was tested by a dynamic method. The amount of products of surface reaction was evaluated using thermal analysis. The results revealed that the main product of oxidation, dimethyl disulfide, is adsorbed in pores smaller than 50 Å. There is apparent competition for adsorption sites between water (moist conditions) and dimethyl disulfide. The competition is won by the latter molecule due to its strong adsorption in the carbon pore system. Although dimethyl disulfide has to compete with water for the adsorption sites it can not be formed in a significant quantity without water.

CARBON COMPOSITE MEMBRANES,"A novel membrane named carbon whisker membrane (CWM) is introduced for an advanced filtration process. The CWM is a tubular ceramic membrane with a layer of vapor-grown carbon fibers (VGCF) grown on the surface of the membrane. We employed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of methane with the presence of catalysts to fabricate the CWM and examined its performances on filtration processes. It was found that, in the process, the VGCFs on the membrane acted as “buffers” for preventing impurities such as micro-particles or bio-materials in the liquid not to direct contact with the membrane body so that the problem of fouling which commonly occurred in the conventional membrane separation processes can be solved. As a result, the life time of the membrane and the flux of filtrate were enhanced. Moreover, the VGCFs layer has a self-cleaning function, that is, the flexible fibers can remove attached particles easily during the filtration or a simply cleaning process after the filtration. This phenomenon is similar to the lotus effect known in the environmental nanotechnology. In addition to the CWM, we report another type of carbon membrane called carbon-coated ceramic membrane. The membrane consists of a tubular porous ceramic substrate which is made by sintering of granular ceramics and a thin carbon film was coated on granular ceramic by CVD method. By controlling the thickness of deposited carbon film, we enabled to control the pore size of the carbon-coated ceramic membrane. Moreover, the carbon thin film changes the properties of the membrane such as hydrophobicity, thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity.

ADSORPTION IN MICROPOROUS MATERIALS: ANALYTICAL EQUATIONS FOR TYPE I ISOTHERMS AT HIGH PRESSURE,"Existing analytical equations for Type I isotherms such as the Langmuir equation and its modifications fail to describe experimental adsorption isotherms at high pressure.

Experimental adsorption isotherms attain a maximum value in the amount adsorbed and then fall to zero. At the critical temperature of the gas, the maximum in the isotherm occurs at a pressure of about 10 bars and the zero occurs at a much higher pressure of several hundred bars. For subcritical gases, the maximum occurs at lower pressure and for supercritical gases the maximum occurs at higher pressure. The observed behavior of high-pressure adsorption isotherms can be predicted from the low-pressure (sub-atmospheric) portion by separating the Type I behavior expected for absolute adsorption from the experimental behavior observed for excess adsorption.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704320_0006,[]

FREEZING/MELTING IN POROUS CARBONS,"We report molecular simulation and experimental results for the freezing/melting behavior of simple fluids adsorbed in porous carbons having slit-shaped or cylindrical geometry. In the simulations we use simple models for activated carbon fibers of pore width 1.5 nm and multi-walled carbon nanotubes of diameter 5 nm. Experimental studies employ dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and nonlinear dielectric effect measurements. We show that the solid-fluid phase behavior depends on two main parameters, the pore width H* (or diameter D*) and a parameter measuring the ratio of the fluid-wall to fluid-fluid attractive interaction (α). For slit-shaped pores, values of α larger than unity lead to an increase in the freezing temperature of the confined fluid with respect to that of the bulk, and values of α smaller than unity produce a decrease in the freezing temperature. Contact layer and hexatic phases were also observed for some systems. The hexatic phase was found in slit-shaped pores with larger α values, and is stable over extended temperature ranges. For cylindrical pores, our results for a D=9.7σ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704320_0002,[]
ADSORPTION EQUILIBRIA OF SUB-CRITICAL AND SUPER-CRITICAL FLUIDS IN CARBONACEOUS MATERIALS,"In this paper, we present an overview of a number of techniques used to characterize the adsorption equilibria of sub- and super-critical fluids in nonporous carbon black and porous activated carbon. Tools such as the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation (GCMC), Density Functional Theory (DFT), Molecular Layer Structure Theory (MLST) of Ustinov and Do, and enhanced molecular layering and pore filling proposed by Do and his co-workers will be discussed. Although the GCMC provides the brute force calculation of molecular interactions and its results have been used as a benchmark for other techniques to compare with, its extremely time consuming computation makes the other techniques more appealing to engineers and experimentalists. Despite the ever-increasing computing power of today personal computer, the advantage of simpler methods is warranted for their role in solving practical problems. Furthermore, added to this advantage is the good performance in terms of the prediction power of the simpler methods. All these tools will be discussed in this paper regarding their applications to adsorption of super and sub-critical fluids in carbonaceous materials, such as graphitised thermal carbon black and activated carbon.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704320_0001,[]

DISCS AND MAGNETOSPHERES,"We discuss close binary accretion flows onto magnetic neutron stars and white dwarfs. The original picture of disc flow disrupted by flow along magnetic fieldlines at some inner radius fails in most cases, the exception being neutron–star binaries in which the companion overflows it Roche lobe. In wind accretion, or Roche lobe overflow onto a magnetic white dwarf, the flow is ill–understood, and disc models cannot account for the observed angular momentum budget of the binary. We discuss recent progress in these areas.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814350976_0007,[]

ECLIPSE MAPPING OF ACCRETION DISKS: THE FIRST DECADE,"Observations of eclipse light curves are being used to make maps of the accretion disks in eclipsing cataclysmic variables. By observing the structure of real accretion disks, we can test models of the structure of accretion disk atmospheres, learn about accretion disk viscosity by tracking time-variations in the structure of dwarf nova disks undergoing outbursts, and measure mass accretion rates in systems at different binary periods to test ideas about the long-term evolution of cataclysmic variables. The observed disk structures in dwarf novae during outburst and in long-period nova-like variables confirm the T α R",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814350976_0005,[]
ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSPORT IN LOW MASS ACCRETION DISKS,"We consider the transport of angular momentum in accretion disks that are low mass, in the sense that the gravitational forces produced by the material in these disks has a negligible effect on disk dynamics. There is no established consensus on how this transport takes place. We note that for phenomenological reasons the traditional α model is probably not a good description of real disks. Here we briefly review a few of the more promising models. These include models in which angular momentum transport is driven by shocks, and by magnetic field instabilities. The latter is more promising, but requires a dynamo. We note that the direction of angular momentum transport due to convection in a conducting disk is not known as competing mechanisms are at work. We briefly discuss a number of possible dynamo mechanisms, and their problems. We then give a detailed exposition of the internal wave driven dynamo model, in which internal waves excited at large radii drive an α – Ω dynamo. The azimuthal magnetic field produced in this way is unstable to a magnetic shearing instability (MSI), which drives nearly isotropic turbulent eddys with typical fluid velocities of ~ V",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814350976_0003,[]

"RESONANCE EXTRACTION, PHASE MATCHING METHOD AND THE SURFACE PATHS FOR FINITE ELASTIC CYLINDERS","In this paper, the discussion is focused on the research which the author carried out in recent years in the Acoustics Group headed by Prof. H. Überall at The Catholic University of America. The studies, based on the resonance scattering theory (RST), mainly comprise: resonance extractions in experiments; the phase matching method and the surface paths examination for finite cylinders and spheroids submerged in water, in the case of axial incidence and oblique incidence by acoustic waves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0011,[]
THE FINITE ELEMENT/BOUNDARY ELEMENT APPROACH TO THE RADIATION AND SCATTERING OF SUBMERGED SHELLS INCLUDING INTERNAL STRUCTURE OR EQUIPMENT,"This chapter introduces the use of the finite element/boundary element method for analysis of submerged shell structures of arbitrary shape with and without internal structures and/or equipment. The finite element method is employed to develop a mathematical model of the submerged shell structure and the boundary element method is used to represent the surrounding fluid. Several boundary element formulations are presented including those for linear isoparametric, quadratic isoparametric, superparametric, and wave superpostition (off-boundary) elements. Special techniques for representing internal structures which may be used within the finite element/boundary element framework include the component mode synthesis (CMS) and dynamic direct stiffness method (DDSM). The coupling of the finite element and boundary element methods is also presented including the reduced fluid mesh (RFM) algorithm for coupling arbitrary meshes. Several examples of radiation and scattering from shells with known solutions or experiments are compared with finite element/boundary element solutions. A discussion of wavetype identification using phase matching, wavenumber analysis and cancellation theory is included. Finally, recently published radiation and scattering solutions involving internal structures and equipment are analyzed using the finite element/boundary element method.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0010,[]
ACOUSTIC SCATTERING FROM A CIRCULAR CYLINDRICAL SHELL IMMERSED IN WATER: GENERATION AND RERADIATION OF GUIDED WAVES,"Acoustic scattering from an isotropic elastic hollow cylindrical shell of infinite length, excited by an obliquely incident plane acoustic wave is investigated. The use of ""classic"" M.I.I.R. (Method of Isolation and Identification of Resonances) is limited because of the refraction of the surface wave: the stationary state generated at a resonance frequency occurs out of the insonified area of the cylindrical shell. A new method called M.I.I.R. ""in propagation"" allows an isolation and an identification of resonances in a wider range of incident angle, contrary to the configuration of transducers according to Snell-Descartes' law (""classic"" M.I.I.R.). The guided waves p = 1 and p = 2 are particularly studied. The analysis of the theoretical width Γ of the resonances justifies the presence or the absence of resonances generated at a given incident angle. The radiation of these guided waves at the end of the cylindrical shell is also investigated. The agreement between the experimental and theoretical angular diagrams confirms the choice of axial theoretical displacement. Its evolution through the thickness is identical to the displacement of a shear (SH) wave in a plate and allows the characterisation of each type of guided wave.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0009,[]
ON SOME GENERAL MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SYSTEM ELASTIC PLATE — ACOUSTIC MEDIUM,"Boundary value contact problems (BVCP) are the problems of mathematical physics, whose statement contains some conditions at particular points or lines of the boundary. The problems of interaction between an elastic plate with some inhomogeneities and an acoustic medium are BVCP. The purpose of this paper is to discuss some pure mathematical aspects of the BVCP, such as the correct functional classes and Fredholm type equations for the solution, the completeness of eigenfunctions, the connection between the BVCP and supersymmetric quantum mechanics, paritial radiation conditions, limiting absorption principle, existence of eigenfunctions in infinite domains, uniqueness of the solution, ""optical"" theorem, and so on.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0007,[]
MATHEMATICAL ASPECTS OF WAVE PHENOMENA IN A WAVE GUIDE WITH ELASTIC WALLS AND OPERATOR POLYNOMIALS,The mathematical aspects of wave phenomena in a wave guide with elastic walls are considered with the help of modern methods of the theory of operator polynomials. It is proved that the eigenfunctions of the transverse cross-section form a basis of the corresponding Hilbert space. The radiation conditions are formulated on the base of the study of the energy fluxes associated with particular modes. The critical frequencies are studied. The abstract differential equation formulation of the problem of excitation of a wave guide is given. An extensive program of the study of wave guides with elastic walls is described.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0006,[]
"REFLECTIVITY RESPONSE OF A SUBMERGED LAYER WITH DENSITY, SOUND VELOCITY AND ABSORPTION GRADIENTS","This paper presents a theoretical study of sound wave propagation through media whose properties change along one of the coordinate rectangular axes, properties that remain constant in the plane orthogonal to this axis. The first layer of the ocean surface, the sea bottom or special composite materials could be modeled as such an inhomogeneous medium where the density, sound velocity and absorption of acoustical energy varies along one axis. The results were applied to obtain the reflection coefficient of an inhomogeneous layer of a given thickness, density, velocity and absorption gradient, sandwiched between the same homogeneous and semiinfinite media (water). It was concluded that the reflection coefficient of the layer varies with the frequency in a nontypical way at low frequencies while at high frequencies it shows a periodic variation, dependent of the physical and geometrical properties of the material and the inhomogeneities.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0005,[]
PROGRESS IN UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC MODELING,"Recent progress in the development and application of underwater acoustic modeling technologies is reviewed. A hierarchical categorization of underwater acoustic models is presented to demonstrate the interrelationships among environmental, basic acoustic, and sonar performance models. Attention is focused on the category of basic acoustic models, which includes propagation, noise and reverberation models. The mathematical foundations of basic acoustic models are briefly reviewed and summaries of available models are presented to illustrate state-of-the-art technologies. New applications for modeling technologies in inverse acoustic sensing of the oceans, shallow-water acoustics, and coupled ocean-acoustic modeling are highlighted. Directions for future research, with an emphasis on defense conversion, are suggested in light of recent changes in the geopolitical landscape. Emerging trends in computational capabilities, mathematical techniques and data sources are also discussed.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812811950_0004,[]
