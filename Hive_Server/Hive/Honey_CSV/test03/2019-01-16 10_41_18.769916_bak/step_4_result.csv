String Theory and M-Theory,"This chapter presents an overview of string theory and M-theory. It introduces the basic concepts together with a brief history of how the subject was developed.

CONSISTENT DISCRETE SPACE-TIME,"We review recent efforts to construct gravitational theories on discrete space-times, usually referred to as the ‚Äúconsistent discretization‚Äù approach. The resulting theories are free of constraints at the canonical level and therefore allow to tackle many problems that cannot be currently addressed in continuum quantum gravity. In particular the theories imply a natural method for resolving the big bang (and other types) of singularities and predict a fundamental mechanism for decoherence of quantum states that might be relevant to the black hole information paradox. At a classical level, the theories may provide an attractive new path for the exploration of issues in numerical relativity. Finally, the theories can make direct contact with several kinematical results of continuum loop quantum gravity. We review in broad terms several of these results and present in detail as an illustration the classical treatment with this technique of the simple yet conceptually challenging model of two oscillators with constant energy sum.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0015,[]
LOOP QUANTUM COSMOLOGY,"The expansion of our universe, when followed backward in time, implies that it emerged from a phase of huge density, the big bang. These stages are so extreme that classical general relativity combined with matter theories is not able to describe them properly, and one has to refer to quantum gravity. A complete quantization of gravity has not yet been developed, but there are many results about key properties to be expected. When applied to cosmology, a consistent picture of the early universe arises which is free of the classical pathologies and has implications for the generation of structure which are potentially observable in the near future.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0014,[]

Among the issues which will be discussed are the role of quantum effects in black hole physics and in cosmology, the effects of quantum violations of the classical energy conditions, and inequalities which constrain the extent of such violations. We will also examine the first steps beyond semiclassical gravity, when the effects of spacetime geometry fluctuations start to appear.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0011,[]

This article discusses the conceptual basis, founded on special and general relativity, for navigation using GPS. Relativistic principles and effects of practical importance include the constancy of the speed of light, the equivalence principle, the Sagnac effect, time dilation, gravitational frequency shifts, and relativity of synchronization. Experimental tests of relativity obtained with a GPS receiver aboard the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite will be discussed.

WAS EINSTEIN RIGHT?: TESTING RELATIVITY AT THE CENTENARY,"We review the experimental evidence for Einstein's special and general relativity. A variety of high precision null experiments verify the weak equivalence principle and local Lorentz invariance, while gravitational redshift and other clock experiments support local position invariance. Together these results confirm the Einstein Equivalence Principle which underlies the concept that gravitation is synonymous with spacetime geometry, and must be described by a metric theory. Solar system experiments that test the weak-field, post-Newtonian limit of metric theories strongly favor general relativity. The Binary Pulsar provides tests of gravitational-wave damping and of strong-field general relativity. Recently discovered binary pulsar systems may provide additional tests. Future and ongoing experiments, such as the Gravity Probe B Gyroscope Experiment, satellite tests of the Equivalence principle, and tests of gravity at short distance to look for extra spatial dimensions could constrain extensions of general relativity. Laser interferometric gravitational-wave observatories on Earth and in space may provide new tests of gravitational theory via detailed measurements of the properties of gravitational waves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0008,[]

Large Underground Detectors for Proton Decay and Neutrino Physics,"This chapter tells the story of several decades of experimental physics done deep underground with huge detectors. Not for the first time in the history of science, the most exciting signals were not the ones originally sought. Large underground detectors were originally designed and built to search for the decay of the proton, which was predicted by Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). Later, these same detectors studied solar, supernova, and atmospheric neutrinos. The unambiguous discovery of neutrino mass and oscillations was a highlight of the end of last century; the solution to the solar neutrino problem was a highlight of the beginning of this century. Current-generation detectors acting as targets for reactor and beam neutrinos have been steadily improving our understanding of neutrinos.

We give a brief review of a few key experimental and theoretical developments in the history of this sub-field of nuclear physics as well as a short outlook, focusing on weak decays, parity-violation in electron scattering, and searches for permanent electric dipole moments of the neutron and neutral atoms‚Ä¶",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0006,[]

Symmetries and Dynamical Symmetries in Nuclei,"Nuclei are very complex systems. Even without going to the level of quarks and gluons, they are systems of strongly interacting protons and neutrons (nucleons). Their number is usually higher than in a few-body system. It is also sufficiently small and cannot be treated statistically. In spite of their complexity, nuclei exhibit some simple regularities, which may be expressed by simple models. The most important regularity is the apparent independent motion of nucleons. The success of the shell model in describing many aspects of nuclear physics is based on this regularity. The shell structure leads to many symmetries which are briefly considered in this review. Only those that are associated with the spherical shell model will be presented. Nuclei that exhibit collective phenomena, like rotational spectra, are well described by a deformed potential well. They will not be discussed here. The limited space does not allow derivation of many results and they will simply be quoted. This allows a rather concise overview of some important symmetries and dynamical symmetries of nuclear states‚Ä¶",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0004,[]

CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS IN THE PHASE-SPACE TOMOGRAPHIC APPROACH,"Lyapunov exponents are constructed using the tomography map in classical and quantum phase space. The marginal distributions being well defined probabilities, the correspondence between classical and quantum notions is clear. Providing an unambiguous extension of the notion of Lyapunov exponent to quantum mechanics, the method is also computationally efficient to obtain analytical results for the Lyapunov exponent, both classical and quantum. Examples are worked out and some insight is obtained on the taming effect of quantum mechanics on classical chaos.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812799760_0032,[]
THE METAL-INSULATOR TRANSITION IN 2D AND NEW PHASES OF QUANTUM LOCALISATION,"We describe a theory for the 2D electron system with defects which takes into account both electron-electron and electron-defect interactions. The approach is based on known properties of electrons in the low density limit. Our results provide a basis for understanding some of the properties of the metal insulator transition. The zero temperature phase diagram of localised and delocalised states as a function of electron density, defect concentration, and magnetic field are in good agreement with experiment.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812799760_0030,[]
ELECTRONIC MOLECULES IN CONDENSED MATTER,"Molecules may be created not only from atoms but also from electrons. If for molecules consisting of atoms the glue which is binding atoms into molecules is the electron cloud around these atoms then for electronic molecules the glue which binds these electrons into an electronic molecule is the phonon cloud. But atomic molecules are drastically different from electronic molecules. Their shapes and sizes are not well defined although they vary within some limits. We show that electronic molecules may arise in solids with rather narrow bands. In many situations, for example in metal and magnetic oxides materials, these molecules have a linear shape and therefore we call them ""electron strings"". They arise primarily in oxide materials with not very wide bands, like HTSC, due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions although antiferromagnetic correlations are also very important. We estimate the string length and the number of particles self-trapped into a single string, taking into account the typical parameters of cuprates, such as ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812799760_0029,[]

This approximation is valid for weak interactions and/or low densities. It relates to the extended quasi-particle approximation for the spectral function.

RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS OF MANY-BODY SYSTEMS,Relativistic quantum dynamics requires a unitary representation of the Poincar√© group on the Hilbert space of states.

This approach should be useful in bridging the gap between few-body dynamics based on phenomenological mass operators and on quantum field theory.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812799760_0004,[]

PHYSICS WITH LARGE EXTRA DIMENSIONS,"A theory with such a mathematical beauty cannot be wrong: this was one of the main arguments in favor of string theory, which unifies all known physical theories of fundamental interactions in a single coherent description of the universe. But no one has ever observed strings, not even indirectly, neither the space of extra dimensions where they live. However, there is a hope that the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù dimensions of string theory are much larger than what we thought in the past and they become within experimental reach in the near future, together with the strings themselves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0025,[]
ON THE ACCURACY OF THE POST-NEWTONIAN APPROXIMATION,"We apply standard post-Newtonian methods in general relativity to locate the innermost circular orbit (ICO) of irrotational and corotational binary black-hole systems. We find that the post-Newtonian series converges well when the two masses are comparable. We argue that the result for the ICO which is predicted by the third post-Newtonian (3PN) approximation is likely to be very close to the ‚Äúexact‚Äù solution, within 1% of fractional accuracy or better. The 3PN result is also in remarkable agreement with a numerical calculation of the ICO in the case of two corotating black holes moving on exactly circular orbits. The behaviour of the post-Newtonian series suggests that the gravitational dynamics of two bodies of comparable masses does not resemble that of a test particle on a Schwarzschild background. This leads us to question the validity of some post-Newtonian resum-mation techniques that are based on the idea that the field generated by two black holes is a deformation of the Schwarzschild space-time.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0022,[]

WHAT GRAVITATIONAL SIGNALS SAY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND THE EVOLUTION OF ASTROPHYSICAL SOURCES,"Gravitational waves transport very detailed information on the structure and evolution of astrophysical sources. For instance a binary system in the early stages of its evolution emits a wavetrain at specific frequencies that depend on the characteristics of the obital motion; as the orbit shrinks and circularize, due to radiation reaction effects, the orbiting bodies get closer and tidally interact. This interaction may result in the excitation of the proper modes of oscillation of the stars, and in the emission of gravitational signals that carry information on the mode frequencies, and consequently on the equation of state in the stellar interior. These phenomena may occur either in solar type stars with orbiting planets and in compact binaries, and in this lecture we will discuss different approaches that can be used to study these processes in the framework of General Relativity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0015,[]

Then, we proceed to relic gravitational waves emphasizing their quantum-mechanical origin and the inevitability of their existence. Combining the theory with available observations, we discuss the prospects of direct detection of relic gravitational waves. A considerable part of the paper is devoted to comparison of relic gravitational waves with the density perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin. It is shown how the phenomenon of squeezing of quantum-mechanically generated cosmological perturbations manifests itself in the periodic structures of the metric power spectra and in the oscillatory behaviour of the CMBR multipoles C",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0013,[]
IMAGING THE EARLY UNIVERSE WITH THE BOOMERANG EXPERIMENT,"The BOOMERanG experiment has recently detected temperature fluctuations the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the otherwise isotropic radiation coming from the early Universe. These anisotropies have a low contrast (about 30 ppm) and feature a peculiar angular power spectrum at angles corresponding to sub-horizon scales at recombination. In the current cosmological model, these structures result from acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma. In the framework of the Hot Big Bang theory with the inflationary hypothesis, the statistical properties of the image of the CMB allow us to measure most of the cosmological parameters.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0012,[]
THE INFLATIONARY UNIVERSE,We feel lucky that at the time of this Conference there is more and more evidence that there was an inflationary epoch very early in the history of the universe. In this talk we will describe how we might be able to get some understanding of the paradigm of inflation.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0011,[]
COMMENTS ON COSMOLOGY 2001,"This article gives a brief survey of cosmology to the present day, and then explores a positive but critical approach, looking in turn at issues arising in observations, geometry, and physics, and at the foundational (philosophical) issues that necessarily arise.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0010,[]

NEW TESTS OF THE STRONG EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE AND OF THE INVERSE SQUARE LAW,"This paper reviews recent tests by the E√∂t-Wash group of two basic questions regarding gravity. 1. How does gravity beget gravity, i.e. what is the weight of gravity itself? 2. Could gravity so weak because it propagates in ‚Äúlarge‚Äù extra dimensions that are not accessible to other forces?",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0008,[]

GRAVITATION AND NONLOCALITY,The physical basis of the standard theory of general relativity is examined and a nonlocal theory of accelerated observers is described that involves a natural generalization of the hypothesis of locality. The nonlocal theory is confronted with experiment via an indirect approach. The implications of the results for gravitation are briefly discussed.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0003,[]
A BRIEF HISTORY OF SPACE-TIME,"A brief survey of the space-time structures used in theoretical physics from Newton to Einstein is followed by a discussion of the ways in which the space-time structure of general relativity differs radically from that of all previous theories by virtue of its dynamization of chrono-geometry and the consequent loss of any possibility of a kinematical coordinatization of the points of space-time. After a discussion of the extent to which these features of general relativity can be generalized and extended to any future fundamental theory, a principle of general permutation invariance is proposed and used to evaluate some current attempts to develop a theory of quantum gravity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0002,[]

Chapter 1: Introduction and Point of View,"In this opening chapter, a synthesis is given of the results found in Refs. [1-5, 15-19]. The ideas, procedures, and definitions introduced in this Chapter are drawn from these references. Slight variations in notations may occur. The idea of this overview is to capture many of the over-riding features of the so-called Œ∂-evolution of the various graphs without giving all the many details needed for their complete description.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814632423_0001,[]
