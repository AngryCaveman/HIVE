FIELD THEORIES ON CANONICAL AND LIE-ALGEBRA NONCOMMUTATIVE SPACETIMES,"Field theories on canonical noncommutative spacetimes, which are being studied also in connection with string theory, and on k-Minkowski spacetime, which is a popular example of Lie-algebra noncommutative spacetime, can be naturally constructed by introducing a suitable generating functional for Green functions in energy-momentum space. Direct reference to a star product is not necessary. It is sufficient to make use of the simple properties that the Fourier transform preserves in these spacetimes and establish the rules for products of wave exponentials that are dictated by the non-commutativity of the coordinates. The approach also provides an elementary description of “planar” and “non-planar” Feynman diagrams. We also comment on the rich phenomenology emerging from the analysis of these theories.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0027,[]
PHYSICS WITH LARGE EXTRA DIMENSIONS,"A theory with such a mathematical beauty cannot be wrong: this was one of the main arguments in favor of string theory, which unifies all known physical theories of fundamental interactions in a single coherent description of the universe. But no one has ever observed strings, not even indirectly, neither the space of extra dimensions where they live. However, there is a hope that the “hidden” dimensions of string theory are much larger than what we thought in the past and they become within experimental reach in the near future, together with the strings themselves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0025,[]

POLYAKOV CONJECTURE AND 2+1 DIMENSIONAL GRAVITY,"After briefly reviewing the hamiltonian approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity in absence of matter on closed universes, we consider 2+1 dimensional gravity coupled to point particles in an open universe. We show that the hamiltonian structure of the theory is the result of a conjecture put forward by Polyakov in a different context. A proof is given of such a conjecture. Finally we give the exact quantization of the two particle problem in open space.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0026,[]
