            Effects of penetration level and location of wind turbines on shadow prices and congestion of transmission lines
                ","This paper studies the effects of wind power on electricity market parameters. The penetration level of wind energy, location of wind turbines, and integration of multiple wind turbines are the main topics addressed in this paper. Flow-gate marginal pricing is the main electricity market concept which is analyzed and studied. Stochastic programming including wind power uncertainty is presented to minimize the annual operational cost of generators. The Flow-gate marginal pricing of transmission lines is also calculated. The Flow-gate marginal pricing is scrutinized under various wind power sizing, siting, and settings. The location, number, and capacity of wind turbines are changed to find out their impacts on the network Flow-gate marginal pricing.

The vortex breakdown phenomenon characterised by the specific stretching factor is directly reflected by the decline in normalised circulation.

            The impact of interior dielectric constant and entropic change on HIV-1 complex binding free energy prediction
                ","At present, the calculated binding free energy obtained using the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann (Generalized-Born) surface area (MM/PB(GB)SA) method is overestimated due to the lack of knowledge of suitable interior dielectric constants in the simulation on the interaction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) protease systems with inhibitors. Therefore, the impact of different values of the interior dielectric constant and the entropic contribution when using the MM/PB(GB)SA method to calculate the binding free energy was systemically evaluated. Our results show that the use of higher interior dielectric constants (1.4–2.0) can clearly improve the predictive accuracy of the MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods, and computational errors are significantly reduced by including the effects of electronic polarization and using a new highly efficient interaction entropy (IE) method to calculate the entropic contribution. The suitable range for the interior dielectric constant is 1.4–1.6 for the MM/PBSA method; within this range, the correlation coefficient fluctuates around 0.84, and the mean absolute error fluctuates around 2 kcal/mol. Similarly, an interior dielectric constant of 1.8–2.0 produces a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.76 when using the MM/GBSA method. In addition, the entropic contribution of each individual residue was further calculated using the IE method to predict hot-spot residues, and the detailed binding mechanisms underlying the interactions of the HIV-1 protease, its inhibitors, and bridging water molecules were investigated. In this study, the use of a higher interior dielectric constant and the IE method can improve the calculation accuracy of the HIV-1 system.",https://aca.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5058172,[]

Whereas an increasing number of structures solved by means of serial femtosecond crystallography at XFELs is available, the effect of radiation damage on protein crystals during ultrafast exposures has remained an open question. We used a split-and-delay line based on diffractive X-ray optics at the Linac Coherent Light Source XFEL to investigate the time dependence of X-ray radiation damage to lysozyme crystals. For these tests, crystals were delivered to the X-ray beam using a fixed-target approach. The presented experiments provide probe signals at eight different delay times between 19 and 213 femtoseconds after a single pump event, thereby covering the time-scales relevant for femtosecond serial crystallography. Even though significant impact on the crystals was observed at long time scales after exposure with a single X-ray pulse, the collected diffraction data did not show significant signal reduction that could be assigned to beam damage on the crystals in the sampled time window and resolution range. This observation is in agreement with estimations of the applied radiation dose, which in our experiment was clearly below the values expected to cause damage on the femtosecond time scale.

For example, specific advances have been made in reagent consumption, throughput, integration of multiple assay steps, assay automation, and multiplexing capability. For heterogeneous systems, controlled immobilization of reactants is essential for reliable, sensitive detection of analytes. In most cases, protein immobilization densities are maximized, while native activity and conformation are maintained.

Recent “smart immobilization” methods including the use of light, electrochemical, thermal, and chemical stimuli to attach and detach proteins on demand with precise spatial control are highlighted. Spatially encoded protein immobilization using DNA hybridization for multiplexed assays and reversible protein immobilization surfaces for repeatable assay are introduced as immobilization methods.

Tracking the structural distortion with a 28-nm/700-fs spatio-temporal resolution, we observe an acoustic membrane breathing mode with spatially modulated amplitude, governed by the optical near field structure at the membrane edge. Furthermore, an in-plane polarized acoustic shock wave is launched at the membrane edge, which triggers secondary acoustic shear waves with a pronounced spatio-temporal dependency.
