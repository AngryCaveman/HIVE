String Theory and M-Theory,"This chapter presents an overview of string theory and M-theory. It introduces the basic concepts together with a brief history of how the subject was developed. Although string theory was initially viewed as a radical alternative to quantum field theory, more recent discoveries make it clear that it is actually the logical completion of quantum field theory, and therefore it is not radical at all. The chapter also describes various approaches that are used in the ongoing attempts to account for particle physics phenomenology, and it addresses the question of how predictive the theory is likely to be…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0019,[]

FIELD THEORIES ON CANONICAL AND LIE-ALGEBRA NONCOMMUTATIVE SPACETIMES,"Field theories on canonical noncommutative spacetimes, which are being studied also in connection with string theory, and on k-Minkowski spacetime, which is a popular example of Lie-algebra noncommutative spacetime, can be naturally constructed by introducing a suitable generating functional for Green functions in energy-momentum space. Direct reference to a star product is not necessary. It is sufficient to make use of the simple properties that the Fourier transform preserves in these spacetimes and establish the rules for products of wave exponentials that are dictated by the non-commutativity of the coordinates. The approach also provides an elementary description of “planar” and “non-planar” Feynman diagrams. We also comment on the rich phenomenology emerging from the analysis of these theories.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0027,[]
PHYSICS WITH LARGE EXTRA DIMENSIONS,"A theory with such a mathematical beauty cannot be wrong: this was one of the main arguments in favor of string theory, which unifies all known physical theories of fundamental interactions in a single coherent description of the universe. But no one has ever observed strings, not even indirectly, neither the space of extra dimensions where they live. However, there is a hope that the “hidden” dimensions of string theory are much larger than what we thought in the past and they become within experimental reach in the near future, together with the strings themselves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0025,[]
OPEN-STRING MODELS WITH BROKEN SUPERSYMMETRY,"I review the salient features of three classes of open-string models with broken supersymmetry. These suffice to exhibit, in relatively simple settings, the two phenomena of “brane supersymmetry” and “brane supersymmetry breaking”. In the first class of models, to lowest order supersymmetry is broken both in the closed and in the open sectors. In the second class of models, to lowest order supersymmetry is broken in the closed sector, but is ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0024,[]
SPIN FOAMS AS FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS,"It has been recently shown that a certain non-topological spin foam model can be obtained from the Feynman expansion of a field theory over a group. The field theory defines a natural “sum over triangulations”, which removes the cut off on the number of degrees of freedom and restores full covariance. The resulting formulation is completely background independent: spacetime emerges as a Feynman diagram, as it did in the old two-dimensional matrix models. We show here that ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0023,[]

GAMMA RAY BURSTS: SOME FACTS AND IDEAS,"Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most explosive events after the big bang: their energy output corresponds to a sizeable fraction of a solar mass entirely converted into energy in a few seconds. Although many questions about their progenitors remain to be answered, it is likely that they are generated by a newly formed and fast spinning black hole. The colossal power characterizing GRBs is carried by a surprisingly small amount of matter, which is accelerated to speeds differing from c by one part in ten thousands. GRBs are then the most (special and general) relativistic objects we know of. Since GRBs are the brightest sources at high redshift, albeit for a limited amount of time, they are also the best torchlights we have to shine the far universe.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0021,[]
WHAT CAN WE LEARN ABOUT NEUTRON STARS FROM GRAVITY-WAVE OBSERVATIONS?,"In the next few years, the first detections of gravity-wave signals using Earth-based interferometric detectors will begin to provide precious new information about the structure and dynamics of compact bodies such as neutron stars. The intrinsic weakness of gravity-wave signals requires a proactive approach to modeling the prospective sources and anticipating the shape of the signals that we seek to detect. Full-blown 3-D numerical simulations of the sources are playing and will play an important role in planning the gravity-wave data-analysis effort. I review some recent analytical and numerical work on neutron stars as sources of gravity waves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0020,[]
INSTABILITIES OF RELATIVISTIC STARS,"Recent developments on the rotational instabilities of relativistic stars are reviewed. The article provides an account of the theory of stellar instabilities with emphasis on the rotational ones. Special attention is being paid to the study of these instabilities in the general relativistic regime. Issues such as the existence relativistic r-modes, the existence of a continuous spectrum and the CFS instability of the w-modes are discussed in the second half of the article.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0019,[]

WHAT GRAVITATIONAL SIGNALS SAY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND THE EVOLUTION OF ASTROPHYSICAL SOURCES,"Gravitational waves transport very detailed information on the structure and evolution of astrophysical sources. For instance a binary system in the early stages of its evolution emits a wavetrain at specific frequencies that depend on the characteristics of the obital motion; as the orbit shrinks and circularize, due to radiation reaction effects, the orbiting bodies get closer and tidally interact. This interaction may result in the excitation of the proper modes of oscillation of the stars, and in the emission of gravitational signals that carry information on the mode frequencies, and consequently on the equation of state in the stellar interior. These phenomena may occur either in solar type stars with orbiting planets and in compact binaries, and in this lecture we will discuss different approaches that can be used to study these processes in the framework of General Relativity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0015,[]
GRAVITATIONAL RADIATION: A TOOL FOR TESTING GENERAL RELATIVITY,"The regular observation of gravitational radiation by a world-wide network of resonant and laser-interferometric detectors will usher in a new form of astronomy. At the same time, it will provide new and interesting tests of general relativity. We review the current empirical status of general relativity, and discuss three areas in which direct observation of gravitational radiation could test the theory further: polarization of the waves, speed of the waves, and back-reaction of the waves on the evolution of the source.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0014,[]
THE EARLY UNIVERSE ODYSSEY WITH GRAVITATIONAL WAVES,"This contribution summarizes some recent work on gravitational-wave astronomy and, especially, on the generation and detection of relic gravitational waves. We begin with a brief discussion of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves that are likely to be detected first by the coming in operation laser interferometers, such as GEO, LIGO, VIRGO. Then, we proceed to relic gravitational waves emphasizing their quantum-mechanical origin and the inevitability of their existence. Combining the theory with available observations, we discuss the prospects of direct detection of relic gravitational waves. A considerable part of the paper is devoted to comparison of relic gravitational waves with the density perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin. It is shown how the phenomenon of squeezing of quantum-mechanically generated cosmological perturbations manifests itself in the periodic structures of the metric power spectra and in the oscillatory behaviour of the CMBR multipoles C",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0013,[]
IMAGING THE EARLY UNIVERSE WITH THE BOOMERANG EXPERIMENT,"The BOOMERanG experiment has recently detected temperature fluctuations the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the otherwise isotropic radiation coming from the early Universe. These anisotropies have a low contrast (about 30 ppm) and feature a peculiar angular power spectrum at angles corresponding to sub-horizon scales at recombination. In the current cosmological model, these structures result from acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma. In the framework of the Hot Big Bang theory with the inflationary hypothesis, the statistical properties of the image of the CMB allow us to measure most of the cosmological parameters.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0012,[]

THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE: FROM ORIGINS TO ITS FUTURE USES,"Einstein's Equivalence Principle, his grand hypothesis that locally united gravity and inertia, and which led the way toward the full theory of general relativity, is still today being subjected to some of the most precision tests in physics. One of the most sensitive ways to find any additional very weak, long range interaction between matter is to search for a non-universality of gravitational free fall rates. And one of the best ways to test whether the space-time arena's geometry is established solely by the metric tensor field or by also other participating (scalar) fields, is to test the universality of free fall among celestial bodies. We continue today a 400 year lineage of such experiments because they still raise fundamental questions about the details of physical law.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0004,[]
20 Years of Asia-Europe Meeting from 1996 to 2016: An Active Partnership – Ready for the Next Decades,"When I think about Asia, it is the busy street-life and the modern skylines of so many vibrant Asian cities which first come to my mind. They are the most visible signs of the Asia-Pacific's steady rise and its impressive growth rates, which are also mirrored by the latest trade figures for Germany: in 2015, the German trade volume with the Asia-Pacific countries grew by 12.7% in imports alone, thereby amounting to a total trade volume of approximately 340 billion Euros. Trade between Asia and Europe is only one aspect. Connectivity is the new name of the game.

Developed economies are on a weak recovery and still fraught with destabilising factors such as the debt crisis and population ageing. The growth of emerging economies slowed significantly while economic and financial risks are piling up. In a time of post-crisis, the world economy risks the possibility of entering into a “new normal” of prolonged low-speed growth. All countries are faced with the urgent task of finding new paths to sustain growth and withstand risks. Against such a background, connectivity has become the new focus of both Asian and European countries.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140257_0003,[]

THE TWISTOR APPROACH TO SPACE-TIME STRUCTURES,"An outline of twistor theory is presented. Initial motivations (from 1963) are given for this type of non-local geometry, as an intended scheme for unifying quantum theory and space-time structure. Basic twistor geometry and algebra is exhibited, and it is shown that this provides a complex-manifold description of classical (spinning) massless particles. Simple quantum commutation rules lead to a concise representation of massless particle wavefunctions, in terms of contour integrals or (more profoundly) holomorphic 1st cohomology. Non-linear versions give elegant representations of anti-self-dual Einstein (or Yang-Mills) fields, describing left-handed non-linear gravitons (or Yang-Mills particles). A brief outline of the current status of the ‘googly problem’ is provided, whereby the right-handed particles would also be incorporated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0017,[]

LOOP QUANTUM COSMOLOGY,"The expansion of our universe, when followed backward in time, implies that it emerged from a phase of huge density, the big bang. These stages are so extreme that classical general relativity combined with matter theories is not able to describe them properly, and one has to refer to quantum gravity. A complete quantization of gravity has not yet been developed, but there are many results about key properties to be expected. When applied to cosmology, a consistent picture of the early universe arises which is free of the classical pathologies and has implications for the generation of structure which are potentially observable in the near future.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0014,[]
QUANTUM GEOMETRY AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS,"The goal of this article is to present a broad perspective on loop quantum gravity, a non-perturbative, background independent approach to the problem of unification of general relativity and quantum physics, based on a specific theory of quantum Riemannian geometry. The chapter is addressed to non-experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on underlying ideas, conceptual issues and the overall status of the program rather than mathematical details and associated technical subtleties. This review complements that by Martin Bojowald which focusses on applications of quantum geometry to cosmology.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0013,[]
SPACETIME IN SEMICLASSICAL GRAVITY,"This article will summarize selected aspects of the semiclassical theory of gravity, which involves a classical gravitational field coupled to quantum matter fields. Among the issues which will be discussed are the role of quantum effects in black hole physics and in cosmology, the effects of quantum violations of the classical energy conditions, and inequalities which constrain the extent of such violations. We will also examine the first steps beyond semiclassical gravity, when the effects of spacetime geometry fluctuations start to appear.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0011,[]
Beyond Einstein: Unifying General Relativity with Quantum Physics,"…a really new field of experience will always lead to crystallization of a new system of scientific concepts and laws…when faced with essentially new intellectual challenges, we continually follow the example of Columbus who possessed the courage to leave the known world in almost the insane hope of finding land again beyond the sea.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_others03,[]
RELATIVITY IN THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM,"The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses accurate, stable atomic clocks in satellites and on the ground to provide world-wide position and time determination. These clocks have gravitational and motional frequency shifts which are so large that, without carefully accounting for numerous relativistic effects, the system would not work. This article discusses the conceptual basis, founded on special and general relativity, for navigation using GPS. Relativistic principles and effects of practical importance include the constancy of the speed of light, the equivalence principle, the Sagnac effect, time dilation, gravitational frequency shifts, and relativity of synchronization. Experimental tests of relativity obtained with a GPS receiver aboard the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite will be discussed. Recently frequency jumps arising from satellite orbit adjustments have been identified as relativistic effects.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0010,[]
RECEIVING GRAVITATIONAL WAVES,"The quest for successful reception of gravitational waves is a long story, with the ending still to be written. In this article, I trace the story from thought experiment, through increasingly sophisticated design and prototyping stages, to the point where observations of unprecedented sensitivity are now getting under way. In the process, one can see the sort of effort that is required to transform beautiful and simple relativistic ideas into sensitive experiments that actually work.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0009,[]
PROBING SPACE-TIME THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS,Einstein's equations describe gravity using an elegant but complicated set of equations. Finding astrophysically relevant solutions to these equations requires the most sophisticated numerical algorithms and powerful supercomputers available. The search for astrophysical solutions has made numerical relativity one of the most active areas of research in gravitational physics. Of particular interest in numerical relativity has been simulating the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries involving black holes and neutrons stars. The outcome from these simulations will bring general relativity into harmony with the observations of gravitational radiation that are expected to take place in the immediate future. This article highlights current progress in numerical relativity. It also attempts to envision the future of this field and its integration with gravitational wave astronomy.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0006,[]

THE NATURE OF SPACETIME SINGULARITIES,Present knowledge about the nature of spacetime singularities in the context of classical general relativity is surveyed. The status of the BKL picture of cosmological singularities and its relevance to the cosmic censorship hypothesis are discussed.

Einstein's Universe: Ramifications of General Relativity,"When Henry Moore visited the University of Chicago … I had the occasion to ask him how one should view sculpture: from afar or from nearby. Moore's response was that the greatest sculpture can be viewed —indeed should be viewed— from all distances since new aspect of beauty will be revealed at every scale. In the same way, the general theory of relativity reveals strangeness in the proportion at any level in which one may explore its consequences.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_others02,[]
"DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTS OF SPACE, TIME AND SPACE-TIME FROM NEWTON TO EINSTEIN","The concept of physical change brings together the concepts of space and time. The evolution of the latter two concepts, and of relation between them, in physical theories from Newtonian mechanics to general relativity is outlined, culminating in the development of the concept of space-time and its dynamization. The chrono-geometrical and inertio-gravitational space-time structures are defined, and the compatibility relations between the two are discussed. The philosophical debate between absolute and relational concepts of space and then of space-time is reviewed, as is the contrast between pre-general-relativistic theories with fixed background space-time structures and background-free general relativistic theories. Some implications of this contrast for the problem of quantum gravity are indicated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0001,[]

ENERGY IN SLOVENIA AND CROATIA: CHALLENGES AND POSSIBILITIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY,"Three components of a strategy to reduce the negative environmental impact of energy use in Slovenia and Croatia are proposed. This strategy is based on energy production and energy consumption data, which are presented and analyzed for Slovenia and Croatia. The first component is maximising the use of renewable energy sources. The second strategy component comprises scenarios for changing consumption patterns to meet the sustainability requirements. The third one is emphasising fundamental curiosity driven research that throughout the history has proven to be the most effective solution for various problems including those of energy production. These strategies are being analyzed for Slovenia and Croatia. Besides the technology fix we discuss also social implications of a change in consumption patterns. These three components of the strategy aim not only to meet the requirements of the Kyoto protocol and EU standards, but to make significant progress toward achieving genuine sustainable development according to the original Brundtland Commission definition.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0031,[]
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL URBAN BUSES OPERATING IN THE CITY OF PORTO,"The aim of the CUTE project was to develop and demonstrate an emission-free and low-noise transport system, including the accompanying energy infrastructure, which has great potential for reducing the global greenhouse effect towards the Kyoto protocol, improving the quality of the atmosphere and life in densely populated areas and conserving fossil resources. For the CUTE project a total of 27 buses were built by EvoBus. These vehicles are based on the Mercedes-Benz Citaro model city bus and run on hydrogen using fuel cells for power generation. One of the participating cities was Porto, where the local bus company (STCP – Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto) is operating three buses. The hydrogen infrastructure is supplied by BP. The hydrogen is produced centrally by electrolysis from grid electricity. In the project, IST is conducting the study of the environmental impact (based on a well to wheel approach) of the operation of the buses and the comparison with conventional technologies (Diesel, compressed natural gas and electricity). This will include measurements of the actual consumptions of the vehicles for the different routes, identification of the road profiles, driving behavior, load and ambient conditions.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0030,[]
