String Theory and M-Theory,"This chapter presents an overview of string theory and M-theory. It introduces the basic concepts together with a brief history of how the subject was developed. Although string theory was initially viewed as a radical alternative to quantum field theory, more recent discoveries make it clear that it is actually the logical completion of quantum field theory, and therefore it is not radical at all. The chapter also describes various approaches that are used in the ongoing attempts to account for particle physics phenomenology, and it addresses the question of how predictive the theory is likely to be…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0019,[]

THE TWISTOR APPROACH TO SPACE-TIME STRUCTURES,"An outline of twistor theory is presented. Initial motivations (from 1963) are given for this type of non-local geometry, as an intended scheme for unifying quantum theory and space-time structure. Basic twistor geometry and algebra is exhibited, and it is shown that this provides a complex-manifold description of classical (spinning) massless particles. Simple quantum commutation rules lead to a concise representation of massless particle wavefunctions, in terms of contour integrals or (more profoundly) holomorphic 1st cohomology. Non-linear versions give elegant representations of anti-self-dual Einstein (or Yang-Mills) fields, describing left-handed non-linear gravitons (or Yang-Mills particles). A brief outline of the current status of the ‘googly problem’ is provided, whereby the right-handed particles would also be incorporated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0017,[]

SYNCHROTRON RADIATION,"As early as 1900, immediately after the pioneer formulation by Liénard and Wiechert of the retarded potentials of a point charge (electron), calculations of the characteristics of the radiation from an accelerated electron or electron beam have been performed. But it was not until 1947 when John Blewett actually observed the synchrotron radiation from the beam in the 70-MeV General Electric electron synchrotron, the phenomenon was accepted as physical reality instead of some interesting mathematical deduction. It was soon recognized that the synchrotron radiation provides an extremely brilliant photon beam over a very broad frequency range from infrared to hard x-ray, and hence makes an ideal tool for use in extranuclear research. By the end of the twentieth century there were dozens of electron storage rings operated around the world at energies from a few hundred MeV to 8 GeV for experiments. Here we will study first the properties of the synchrotron radiation and then the effects of the emission of synchrotron radiation on the electron beam.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812702807_0008,[]

CONSISTENT DISCRETE SPACE-TIME,"We review recent efforts to construct gravitational theories on discrete space-times, usually referred to as the “consistent discretization” approach. The resulting theories are free of constraints at the canonical level and therefore allow to tackle many problems that cannot be currently addressed in continuum quantum gravity. In particular the theories imply a natural method for resolving the big bang (and other types) of singularities and predict a fundamental mechanism for decoherence of quantum states that might be relevant to the black hole information paradox. At a classical level, the theories may provide an attractive new path for the exploration of issues in numerical relativity. Finally, the theories can make direct contact with several kinematical results of continuum loop quantum gravity. We review in broad terms several of these results and present in detail as an illustration the classical treatment with this technique of the simple yet conceptually challenging model of two oscillators with constant energy sum.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0015,[]
LOOP QUANTUM COSMOLOGY,"The expansion of our universe, when followed backward in time, implies that it emerged from a phase of huge density, the big bang. These stages are so extreme that classical general relativity combined with matter theories is not able to describe them properly, and one has to refer to quantum gravity. A complete quantization of gravity has not yet been developed, but there are many results about key properties to be expected. When applied to cosmology, a consistent picture of the early universe arises which is free of the classical pathologies and has implications for the generation of structure which are potentially observable in the near future.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0014,[]
SPACE TIME IN STRING THEORY,"This paper explores the holographic description of space-time in string theory. Super-Poincare invariant versions of the theory are described by moduli spaces of S-matrices. The parameters describing the S-matrix have geometrical interpretations in extreme regions of the moduli space, but the S-matrix interpolates smoothly between compact spaces of radically different topology. Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter universes are defined by quantum field theories living on the conformal boundary of AdS space. The geometry of compact factors in the space-time is encoded in internal degrees of freedom of the field theory. The cosmological constant is a discrete input parameter determining the high energy behavior of the system. Later sections discuss the description of stable or unstable de Sitter space-times, and the associated question of the breaking of Supersymmetry, as well as a conjectural holographic theory of quantum space-time geometry.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0012,[]

RELATIVITY IN THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM,"The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses accurate, stable atomic clocks in satellites and on the ground to provide world-wide position and time determination. These clocks have gravitational and motional frequency shifts which are so large that, without carefully accounting for numerous relativistic effects, the system would not work. This article discusses the conceptual basis, founded on special and general relativity, for navigation using GPS. Relativistic principles and effects of practical importance include the constancy of the speed of light, the equivalence principle, the Sagnac effect, time dilation, gravitational frequency shifts, and relativity of synchronization. Experimental tests of relativity obtained with a GPS receiver aboard the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite will be discussed.

PROBING SPACE-TIME THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS,Einstein's equations describe gravity using an elegant but complicated set of equations. Finding astrophysically relevant solutions to these equations requires the most sophisticated numerical algorithms and powerful supercomputers available. The search for astrophysical solutions has made numerical relativity one of the most active areas of research in gravitational physics. Of particular interest in numerical relativity has been simulating the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries involving black holes and neutrons stars. The outcome from these simulations will bring general relativity into harmony with the observations of gravitational radiation that are expected to take place in the immediate future.

MEAN FIELD APPROACH TO QUARK MATTER IN THE NJL MODEL,"The NJL model yields a coupling for scalar meson exchange which is in quite good agreement with what is needed to fit the properties of nuclear matter. Unfortunately, according to the NJL model, quark matter does not saturate until the density has reached the critical value at which chiral symmetry restoration is reached. However, it may be shown that quark matter may saturate at a density for which the effective mass is still finite if the scalar coupling constant is allowed to increase with density. So, for a conveniently generalized NJL model, saturation is reached before chiral symmetry is restored. In the generalized model, restoration of chiral symmetry may occur at a density an order of magnitude higher than nuclear matter density. The properties of hadronic matter in the framework of the generalized model are here discussed.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812799760_0017,[]

Both for symmetric and for pure neutron matter strong evidence of convergence in the expansion is found. Once three-body forces are introduced, the phenomenological saturation point is reproduced and the theory is applied to the study of neutron stars static properties. In the interior of a neutron star, where the baryon density increases above two-three times the saturation density, the onset of hyperons occurs. Extending the theory to include strangeness, the resulting Equation of State turns out to be strongly softened.

High Energy Nuclear Physics: From Bear Mountain to the LHC,"I review the development of high energy nuclear physics, in particular the attempts to make new forms of matter in hadronic collisions. I begin with early experimental work done at the Bevelac, the AGS and the SPS. Early theoretical work concentrated on understanding properties of quark and gluonic matter at high temperature and density, the Quark Gluon Plama (QGP), particularly using the methods of lattice gauge theory. Recent theoretical work has involved attempts to more quantitatively describe data coming from experiments at RHIC and LHC. In addition, new forms of matter have been proposed to describe the early times in hadronic collisions. The Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is the high density gluonic matter that initially composes colliding high energy nuclei. The Glasma is highly coherent color electric and color magnetic fields radiating gluons that eventually thermalize. Methods derivative of strongly interacting gauge theory (AdSCFT Correspondence) have been employed to qualitatively understand finite temperature QCD when the intrinsic strength of interactions is strong. The RHIC and LHC experiments provide compelling experimental data to establish that the matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy is a strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP). To what degree, in my opinion, the sQGP is a thermally equilibrated Quark Gluon Plasma, or a Glasma is not yet determined…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0007,[]

Symmetries and Dynamical Symmetries in Nuclei,"Nuclei are very complex systems. Even without going to the level of quarks and gluons, they are systems of strongly interacting protons and neutrons (nucleons). Their number is usually higher than in a few-body system. It is also sufficiently small and cannot be treated statistically. In spite of their complexity, nuclei exhibit some simple regularities, which may be expressed by simple models. The most important regularity is the apparent independent motion of nucleons. The success of the shell model in describing many aspects of nuclear physics is based on this regularity. The shell structure leads to many symmetries which are briefly considered in this review. Only those that are associated with the spherical shell model will be presented. Nuclei that exhibit collective phenomena, like rotational spectra, are well described by a deformed potential well. They will not be discussed here. The limited space does not allow derivation of many results and they will simply be quoted.

Quarks and a Unified Theory of Nature Fundamental Forces,"Quarks were introduced 50 years ago opening the road towards our understanding of the elementary constituents of matter and their fundamental interactions. Since then, a spectacular progress has been made with important discoveries that led to the establishment of the Standard Theory that describes accurately the basic constituents of the observable matter, namely quarks and leptons, interacting with the exchange of three fundamental forces, the weak, electromagnetic and strong force. Particle physics is now entering a new era driven by the quest of understanding of the composition of our Universe such as the unobservable (dark) matter, the hierarchy of masses and forces, the unification of all fundamental interactions with gravity in a consistent quantum framework, and several other important questions. A candidate theory providing answers to many of these questions is string theory that replaces the notion of point particles by extended objects, such as closed and open strings. In this short note, I will give a brief overview of string unification, describe in particular how quarks and leptons can emerge and discuss what are possible predictions for particle physics and cosmology that could test these ideas.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814618113_0026,[]

The Parton Model and Its Applications,This is a review of the program we started in 1968 to understand and generalize Bjorken scaling and Feynman's parton model in a canonical quantum field theory. It is shown that the parton model proposed for deep inelastic electron scatterings can be derived if a transverse momentum cutoff is imposed on all particles in the theory so that the impulse approximation holds. The deep inelastic electron–positron annihilation into a nucleon plus anything else is related by the crossing symmetry of quantum field theory to the deep inelastic electron–nucleon scattering. We have investigated the implication of crossing symmetry and found that the structure functions satisfy a scaling behavior analogous to the Bjorken limit for deep inelastic electron scattering. We then find that massive lepton pair production in collisions of two high energy hadrons can be treated by the parton model with an interesting scaling behavior for the differential cross-sections. This turns out to be the first example of a class of hard processes involving two initial hadrons.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814618113_0014,[]

Of course, with only strong interactions, the orientation of the asymmetry in the unitary space cannot be specified; one hopes that in some way the selection of specific components of the F-spin by electromagnetism and the weak interactions determines the choice of isotopic spin and hyper-charge directions.…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814618113_0001,[]

It was a recognition that FOSS was born of an idea by Singapore diplomats twenty years earlier, to promote the potential of Small States in the UN, and had been chaired since then by the succeeding Singapore Permanent Representatives. Secretary-General of the UN Mr Ban Ki-moon opened the Conference, which was attended by Member States of the UN, both FOSS and non-FOSS. This was followed by keynote speeches by the President of the UNGA Mr Vuk Jeremic and the US Secretary of State Mrs Hillary Clinton.

For many of us born during that period, we literally saw the city transform before our very eyes. Despite our small land mass and the seemingly insurmountable challenges we faced in the 1960s housing about 2.5 million people, Singapore is now one of the few highly liveable cities that have combined highly dense urban structures with high standards of living, providing a good quality of life for a population of 5.5 million…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814632621_0011,[]
Chapter 10: Foreign Domestic Workers in Singapore: A Neglected Social Issue?,"Foreign domestic workers are a conspicuous presence in Singapore. A stroll through any residential neighbourhood any day of the week will reveal these women accompanying their young charges to childcare or school, taking a slow stroll with an elderly charge for the latter's daily exercise, hanging out the laundry, washing their employers' cars, shopping for groceries, or in small groups chatting as they walk their employers' dogs. On Sundays, they become even more visible in public parks, shopping malls, places of worship, training centres and other public areas as they enjoy a day off. Indeed, foreign domestic workers, or “maids” as they are widely referred to in Singapore, are now a crucial part of Singapore's care and housekeeping landscape, enabling scores of Singaporean women (and, more indirectly, men as well) to go out to work each day or simply enjoy more quality time. Ironically, while visible in this physical sense, too often, the contributions and plight of foreign domestic workers in Singapore — as in many other major cities around the world — are often overlooked. Not surprisingly, foreign domestic workers have been paradoxically described as the “invisible backbone” of many metropolitan economies in which they are found (Sternberg, 2014)…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814632621_0010,[]

PHYSICS OF THE 21ST CENTURY,"When Superstring Theory entered the arena of sub-atomic particle physics, with its first new milestone in 1984, its enthusiastic supporters proclaimed that ‘this would be the physics of the 21st century!’. That statement, of course, was in error by an amount of 16 years. However, today's physics does still have some of its roots in superstring theory and related topological constructions. The undisputed leader in the field is Edward Witten. He has introduced an impressive amount of mathematics into new theories of physics, and vice versa. Some of those theories are highly speculative and difficult to value; they may or may not survive this century. But, results from algebraic topology and other well-established corners of pure mathematics, are finding their way in physics, and they are likely to stay…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812567147_others15,[]

Beyond that scale, we do not believe the present Model can be relied upon. Already in the early 1970's, new symmetry principles were investigated. A theorem was derived stating that internal symmetries, such as the local gauge symmetry of Yang–Mills systems, cannot be combined in a non-trivial manner with space-time symmetries. But this was before the introduction of anti-commutators as possible replacements for commutators in a symmetry algebra.

CONFRONTATION WITH EXPERIMENT,"Glancing through many of the previous chapters, one might be tempted to overlook an important fact: that Physics is an experimental science.

Most of our knowledge concerning the sub-atomic world comes from large particle accelerators and ingeniously designed detectors. To bring order to these enormous piles of observed data is the task of the theoretical physicists. It is here that Yang–Mills theory is claiming numerous successes. As Alvaro De Rújula recalls, experimentalists see it as their task to disprove all theories and all theoreticians, or at least discover things that were not foreseen.

These proven insights into fundamental physics ramify in many directions, and are far from being exhausted. I will discuss three rewarding explorations from my own experience, whose point of departure is the hard Yang–Mills interaction, and whose end is not yet in sight.

PERTURBATION THEORY FOR GAUGE-INVARIANT FIELDS,"A method is developed for the manifestly covariant quantization of gaugeinvariant fields by means of a functional integration. It is shown that for the fields with non-Abelian gauge groups (the Yang–Mills and gravitational fields) fictitious particles appear naturally in the diagram technique, which are not present in the initial Lagrangian. An appearance of these particles restores the transversality of scattering amplitudes and the unitarity of the S-matrix.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812567147_0003,[]
GHOSTS FOR PHYSICISTS,"Even though the Yang–Mills theory was quoted every now and then, a vast majority of theoreticians continued to dismiss the notion of a quantized field. But, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, there were a few stubborn exceptions. Ludwig D. Faddeev is known for his powerful insights in Mathematical Physics, while he understood the language of the more pragmatic physicists who try to interpret experimental data. He, and his co-author V. N. Popov, were also attracted by the challenging questions posed by Feynman, and their way of formulating their results was more concise and accessible to their colleagues, even though a closer study reveals that they did arrive at the same conclusions as DeWitt. The important message of all was that the ghosts discovered by Feynman are due to a Jacobian factor in the functional integral. The Feynman rules are nothing but a perturbative expansion of an integral, and if the variables in an expression for an integral are being transformed, then one has to take Jacobian factors into account…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812567147_others03,[]

Singapore's external trade at $983 billion is 2.5 times its GDP, indicating a heavy dependence on the rest of the world. Singapore has little choice but to be connected to the rest of the world by sea and air transport. Total international arrivals1 number 15 million giving a ratio of 2.9 times to the population, while the volume of sea cargo handled was 581 million tonnes compared to 1.8 million tonnes of air cargo — a mere fraction of the volume of sea cargo handled at our seaports.

Chapter 5: Road Safety,"This chapter provides a review of road safety in the development of land transport in Singapore over the years. The focus is on engineering road safety, together with education and enforcement collaboration efforts with major stakeholders such as the Traffic Police and Singapore Road Safety Council. The chapter begins with a reflection of the past road accident statistics together with related factors like vehicle and population growth, comparing the road safety situation then and now. Next we look at how priorities have changed, with the focus moving from pedestrians to motorcyclists and recently, to cyclists. We elaborate on how Singapore's road safety has improved and also how the city state has become globally benchmarked to be among the safest countries in the world. We recall some inspirational accounts of Singapore's success story in road safety. These accounts will flow with key milestones under the three pillars of road safety: engineering, enforcement and education. Next, we highlight some of the key road safety initiatives that we have developed over the years, with examples of engineering road safety schemes that have been effectively used over the years. These will include major national road safety projects including School Zones and Silver Zones to make our roads safer for young school-children and the increasing number of seniors that comes with an ageing population.

Feynman Geometries,In this paper we introduce a notion of Feynman geometry on which quantum field theories could be properly defined. A strong Feynman geometry is a geometry when the vector space of A∞ structures is finite dimensional. A weak Feynman geometry is a geometry when the vector space of A∞ structures is infinite dimensional while the relevant operators are of trace-class. We construct families of Feynman geometries with “continuum” as their limit.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814725569_0027,[]

"Chern–Simons Theory, Vassiliev Invariants, Loop Quantum Gravity and Functional Integration Without Integration",This paper is an exposition of the relationship between Witten's Chern–Simons functional integral and the theory of Vassiliev invariants of knots and links in three-dimensional space.

This approach makes it possible to discuss the mathematics intrinsic to the functional integral rigorously and without functional integration.

Gauge Concepts in Theoretical Applied Physics,"Gauge concept evolves in the course of nearly one century from Faraday's rather obscure electrotonic state of matter to the physically significant Yang–Mills that underpin today's standard model. As gauge theories improve, links are established with modern observations, e.g. in the Aharonov–Bohm effect, the Pancharatnam–Berry's phase, superconductivity, and quantum Hall effects. In this century, emergent gauge theory is formulated in numerous fields of applied physics like topological insulators, spintronics, and graphene. We will show in this article the application of gauge theory in two particularly useful spin-based phenomena, namely the spin orbit spin torque and the spin Hall effect. These are important fields of study in the engineering community due to great commercial interest in the technology of magnetic memory (MRAM), and magnetic field sensors. Both spin orbit torque and spin Hall perform magnetic switching at low power and high speed.

The 1954 version, physically speaking, had a famous show-stopping defect in the form of what might be called the “Pauli snag,” or the requirement that, in the Lagrangian for non-Abelian gauge theory the mass term for the gauge field has to be zero. How, then, was it possible for (1) to turn into (2)? What unfolding sequence of events made this transition possible, and what does this evolution say about the nature of theories in physics? The transition between (1) and (2) illustrates what historians and philosophers a century from now might still find instructive and stimulating about the development of Yang–Mills theory.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814725569_0022,[]

Some Thoughts About Yang–Mills Theory,"President Guaning Su mentioned that he was very much inspired by the news of parity violation in 1957 and its impact on the Chinese community worldwide.

Generalization of the Yang–Mills Theory,"We suggest an extension of the gauge principle which includes tensor gauge fields. In this extension of the Yang–Mills theory the vector gauge boson becomes a member of a bigger family of gauge bosons of arbitrary large integer spins. The proposed extension is essentially based on the extension of the Poincaré algebra and the existence of an appropriate transversal representations. The invariant Lagrangian is expressed in terms of new higher-rank field strength tensors. It does not contain higher derivatives of tensor gauge fields and all interactions take place through three- and four-particle exchanges with a dimensionless coupling constant. We calculated the scattering amplitudes of non-Abelian tensor gauge bosons at tree level, as well as their one-loop contribution into the Callan–Symanzik beta function. This contribution is negative and corresponds to the asymptotically free theory. Considering the contribution of tensorgluons of all spins into the beta function we found that it is leading to the theory which is conformally invariant at very high energies. The proposed extension may lead to a natural inclusion of the standard theory of fundamental forces into a larger theory in which vector gauge bosons, leptons and quarks represent a low-spin subgroup. We consider a possibility that inside the proton and, more generally, inside hadrons there are additional partons — tensorgluons, which can carry a part of the proton momentum. The extension of QCD influences the unification scale at which the coupling constants of the Standard Model merge, shifting its value to lower energies.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814725569_0015,[]

Quantum Chromodynamics — The Perfect Yang–Mills Gauge Field Theory," My talk today is about the most beautiful of all Yang–Mills Theories (non-Abelian gauge theories), the theory of the strong nuclear interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics, QCD. We are celebrating 60 years of the publication of a remarkable paper which introduced the concept of non-Abelian local gauge symmetries, now called the Yang–Mills theory, to physics. In the introduction to this paper it is noted that the usual principle of isotopic spin symmetry is not consistent with the concept of localized fields. This sentence has drawn attention over the years because the usual principle of isotopic spin symmetry is consistent, it is just not satisfactory. The authors, Yang and Mills, introduced a more satisfactory notion of local symmetry which did not require one to rotate (in isotopic spin space) the whole universe at once to achieve the symmetry transformation. Global symmetries are thus are similar to ‘action at a distance’, whereas Yang–Mills theory is manifestly local…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814725569_0002,[]

Introduction: Foreshadowings of a Normative Division of Labor,"The story of physics certainly includes Archimedes’ discovery of the principle of displacement, and his subsequent books on hydrostatics. About nineteen centuries later, Galileo’s inquiries into free-fall led not only to the discovery of a new law, but also to a fundamental development in method. There is little doubt that Archimedes appealed to experience and, in particular, applied his result to find out that the King’s crown was, as suspected, not pure gold.

FIELD THEORIES ON CANONICAL AND LIE-ALGEBRA NONCOMMUTATIVE SPACETIMES,"Field theories on canonical noncommutative spacetimes, which are being studied also in connection with string theory, and on k-Minkowski spacetime, which is a popular example of Lie-algebra noncommutative spacetime, can be naturally constructed by introducing a suitable generating functional for Green functions in energy-momentum space. Direct reference to a star product is not necessary. It is sufficient to make use of the simple properties that the Fourier transform preserves in these spacetimes and establish the rules for products of wave exponentials that are dictated by the non-commutativity of the coordinates. The approach also provides an elementary description of “planar” and “non-planar” Feynman diagrams. We also comment on the rich phenomenology emerging from the analysis of these theories.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0027,[]
POLYAKOV CONJECTURE AND 2+1 DIMENSIONAL GRAVITY,"After briefly reviewing the hamiltonian approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity in absence of matter on closed universes, we consider 2+1 dimensional gravity coupled to point particles in an open universe.

OPEN-STRING MODELS WITH BROKEN SUPERSYMMETRY,"I review the salient features of three classes of open-string models with broken supersymmetry.

In the second class of models, to lowest order supersymmetry is broken in the closed sector, but is ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0024,[]
SPIN FOAMS AS FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS,"It has been recently shown that a certain non-topological spin foam model can be obtained from the Feynman expansion of a field theory over a group. The field theory defines a natural “sum over triangulations”, which removes the cut off on the number of degrees of freedom and restores full covariance. The resulting formulation is completely background independent: spacetime emerges as a Feynman diagram, as it did in the old two-dimensional matrix models. We show here that ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0023,[]
ON THE ACCURACY OF THE POST-NEWTONIAN APPROXIMATION,"We apply standard post-Newtonian methods in general relativity to locate the innermost circular orbit (ICO) of irrotational and corotational binary black-hole systems. We find that the post-Newtonian series converges well when the two masses are comparable. We argue that the result for the ICO which is predicted by the third post-Newtonian (3PN) approximation is likely to be very close to the “exact” solution, within 1% of fractional accuracy or better. The 3PN result is also in remarkable agreement with a numerical calculation of the ICO in the case of two corotating black holes moving on exactly circular orbits. The behaviour of the post-Newtonian series suggests that the gravitational dynamics of two bodies of comparable masses does not resemble that of a test particle on a Schwarzschild background. This leads us to question the validity of some post-Newtonian resum-mation techniques that are based on the idea that the field generated by two black holes is a deformation of the Schwarzschild space-time.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0022,[]
GAMMA RAY BURSTS: SOME FACTS AND IDEAS,"Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most explosive events after the big bang: their energy output corresponds to a sizeable fraction of a solar mass entirely converted into energy in a few seconds. Although many questions about their progenitors remain to be answered, it is likely that they are generated by a newly formed and fast spinning black hole. The colossal power characterizing GRBs is carried by a surprisingly small amount of matter, which is accelerated to speeds differing from c by one part in ten thousands. GRBs are then the most (special and general) relativistic objects we know of. Since GRBs are the brightest sources at high redshift, albeit for a limited amount of time, they are also the best torchlights we have to shine the far universe.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0021,[]

WHAT GRAVITATIONAL SIGNALS SAY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND THE EVOLUTION OF ASTROPHYSICAL SOURCES,"Gravitational waves transport very detailed information on the structure and evolution of astrophysical sources. For instance a binary system in the early stages of its evolution emits a wavetrain at specific frequencies that depend on the characteristics of the obital motion; as the orbit shrinks and circularize, due to radiation reaction effects, the orbiting bodies get closer and tidally interact. This interaction may result in the excitation of the proper modes of oscillation of the stars, and in the emission of gravitational signals that carry information on the mode frequencies, and consequently on the equation of state in the stellar interior. These phenomena may occur either in solar type stars with orbiting planets and in compact binaries, and in this lecture we will discuss different approaches that can be used to study these processes in the framework of General Relativity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0015,[]

In the current cosmological model, these structures result from acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma.

"2: Composites, Nanocomposites and Hybrid Materials","The research into composite, nanocomposites and hybrid materials in Singapore started in the later 1980s, mainly among the research community at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and later in the A*STAR research institutes. The works then were mostly focused on the processing, the mechanics and the non-destructive testing of conventional glass fibre and carbon fibre composites. The important factors that propelled the composites, nanocomposites and hybrid materials research in Singapore were the substantial increase of research funding support by the government to the local universities and the establishment of the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE) at A*STAR in the late 1990s, as well the local industrial pull which demanded sophisticated materials to support their product development. Now Singapore has one of the world's largest materials engineering community equipped with sound infrastructure, state-of-the-art facilities including those for composites and nanocomposite research. The research into advanced composites research in Singapore has experienced an unparalleled rise in output and impact. This review will focus on the applications of advanced composites as mechanical, thermal and electrical conductive materials. The applications in the biomedical, energy, and environmental areas will be discussed in other chapters…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814730709_0002,[]

A BRIEF HISTORY OF SPACE-TIME,"A brief survey of the space-time structures used in theoretical physics from Newton to Einstein is followed by a discussion of the ways in which the space-time structure of general relativity differs radically from that of all previous theories by virtue of its dynamization of chrono-geometry and the consequent loss of any possibility of a kinematical coordinatization of the points of space-time. After a discussion of the extent to which these features of general relativity can be generalized and extended to any future fundamental theory, a principle of general permutation invariance is proposed and used to evaluate some current attempts to develop a theory of quantum gravity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0002,[]

REMANUFACTURING OF THE RACK AND PINION OF THE POWER STEERING MECHANISM OF THE FAMILY CAR,"Worn out rack and pinion of the power steering mechanisms of a family car can be remanufactured by means of grinding on a CNC machine. However, simple removal of a particular allowance from a rack and a pinion does not help because they have special profiles with non-uniform tooth height. As a result interference takes place on remanufactured mechanisms when the rack travels to the left or to the right from its initial mid-position. This may lock the steering system with catastrophic consequences. To investigate the meshing of virgin and remanufactured rack and pinion ""Mechanica"" software was used (""Motion"" module). The clash points were detected and the rack's profile was modified to prevent interference. The modified profiles were then transferred as MNF and IGES types files to CNC grinding machine and used for remanufacturing of worn out rack and pinion mechanisms.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0072,[]

PROPOSAL OF MEGASONIC VIBRATION INDUCED COOLANT AND ITS APPLICATION TO MACHINING,"This paper outlines the results of using megasonic level vibration induced coolant in machining operation to improve the performance. The performance characteristics of the coolant, which plays the roles of cooling, lubrication and flushing away the machined swarf from the machining zone, are improved. A significant influence on the surface finish is observed in case of non-corrosive aluminum alloy.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0070,[]
RECOVERY OF STRENGTH OF GROUND CERAMICS BY HEATING IN MINUTES,"Machining processes are necessary to finish ceramic materials for precision parts generally, and grinding is usually adopted to improve surface finish, dimensional tolerances or impart a more complex shape. However, the strength of ground ceramics tend to be deteriorated due to flaws formed during grinding operations. This paper presents an attempt to recover the strength of ground ceramics by heating ceramic specimens in few minutes. The strength of heated ceramic specimens increases remarkably both for alumina ceramics and silicon nitride ceramics. Furthermore a simpler heating method using acetylene gas burner is also attempted, and sufficient recovery of ground ceramic specimens is obtained. Those methods will be applicable to improve reliability of mass production ceramic parts for mechanical use.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0069,[]

SEISMIC RESPONSE IN A CITY,"Extremely large effects in terms of intensity and duration characterized the recent tremors in cities of Mexico, Japan and Turkey. Studying the responses of complex substratum models, while considering the ground to be flat, is the traditional approach in the analysis of such earthquakes. However, these models ignore building/soil/building interactions. Evidence exists that explicitly integrating the buildings into the theoretical models will lead to a better understanding and prediction of the tremor’s causes and effects. Such a model is considered in this paper wherein the response of a simplified city with ten buildings, non-equally sized and spaced, located on a substratum with a low velocity layer, is studied. Our results display very strong responses, both inside the buildings and on the ground, which qualitatively match the responses observed in the above-mentioned cities.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704405_0038,[]
RECENT PROGRESS IN THE THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL MODELING OF THIN-LAYER FLOW,"The motion of liquids is of pervasive importance throughout the natural and industrial worlds.

The thinness of the liquid layers can be exploited to simplify the mathematical description of these motions and allow inclusion of other important effects, icluding Marangoni forces associated with surfactants and variable composition, non-Newtonian rheology and gravitational and centrifugal body forces. Foci of our work include the construction of detailed process models which may be used, for example, to better understand the causes of observed defects in industrial coating processes and their remediation, and also fundamental studies which may lead to new applications of the model.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704405_0037,[]

Using the inverse Fourier transform, one can recover the strain, stress, displacement and velocity at any section of the rod.

First the propagation of Lipschitz discontinuities and their blow-up into a shock wave is considered and then, in the case of a system, the blow-up of the solution itself is demonstrated. An application of acceleration wave propagation in an isotropic incompressible hyperelastic medium is then mentioned where two types of wave can propagate, one to the left and the other to the right, though only one of these can ever lead to shock formation. Wave propagation in a layered medium is also mentioned.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704405_0029,[]
HEAT POLYNOMIAL ANALOGS,"The classical heat polynomials are polynomial solutions of the heat equation. They are useful in a function theoretic treatment of the heat equation, serving as a basis for expansion and approximation of other solutions. We generalize these polynomials to more general evolution equations, of arbitrary order and with coefficients depending on the time variable. We have explicit formulas for these polynomials, obtained through expansion of a generating function. We also exhibit pointwise upper bounds on the polynomials, useful in the analysis of series expansions in terms of generalized heat polynomials.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704405_0028,[]
SUPPORT FUNCTION METHOD FOR INVERSE OBSTACLE SCATTERING PROBLEMS,"The knowledge of the Support Function (SF) of a smooth and strictly convex obstacle allows one to reconstruct the obstacle. The SF can be computed if the Scattering Amplitude is known for large values of the wave number k. For the values of k in the resonance region, the SF can only be found approximately. Nevertheless, the results of this paper show that such an SF can be used to find an approximate location of the obstacle. The method is inexpensive, and it does not require extensive data.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704405_0027,[]
A DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION METHOD FOR THE HELMHOLTZ EQUATION IN AN UNBOUNDED WAVEGUIDE,The aim is to simulate an acoustic wave propagating through an unbounded waveguide. We propose an original numerical algorithm using the finite element method and which takes into account in a exact way the behavior of the solution at infinity. The method is based on a fixed point technique applied to the problem set in the truncated domain by imposing on a fictitious border a non-standard boundary condition by means of a Fourier expansion. It can be interpreted as a domain decompostion solver. The numerical results confirm the advantages of this method compared to a classic implementation.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704405_0026,[]
ACOUSTIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN A COMPOSITE OF TWO DIFFERENT POROELASTIC MATERIALS WITH A VERY ROUGH PERIODIC INTERFACE: A HOMOGENIZATION APPROACH,"Homogenization is used to analyze the system of Biot-type partial differential equations in a domain of two different poroelastic materials with a very rough periodic interface. It is shown that by using homogenization, such a rough Interface can be replaced by an equivalent layer within which a system of modified differential equations holds. The coefficients of this new system of equations are certain “effective” parameters. These coefficients are determined by the solutions of certain auxiliary problems which involve the detailed structure of the interface. In this paper, the auxiliary problems are derived and the homogenized system of equations is given.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812704405_0024,[]

MANUFACTURING OF SHORT METAL FIBERS WITH A ROTARY TOOL,"This paper proposes a new method for manufacturing short metal fibers in which a rotary tool with a V -shaped notch formed on the outer peripheral cutting edge is used on a turning machine for cutting a long flow type machined chip into short fibers of predetermined length. It is confirmed by experiments that short and thin metal fibers of materials like SS400 and SUS304 may be produced successfully by selecting appropriate machining conditions such as slant angle, cutting speed, feed and depth of cut.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0067,[]
THE USE OF 3D SIMULATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TOOLING AND TOOL GRINDING PROCESSES,"ANCA Pty Ltd is a leading international manufacturer of multi-axis precision CNC controlled tool grinding machines.

A FEEDING MODULE FOR NANO-POSITIONING,"Nano-positioning is the key to any ultra-precision machines to achieve very fine movements with the resolution of a few nanometres while keeping a high stiffness. This paper presents a feeding module for a nano-positioning system in our newly developed multi-functional ultra-precision machine. The module includes the following key components: (a) a PZT actuator, which is used to provide a fine feeding movement, (b) a pair of capacitive sensor with a noise-limited resolution of 0.07nm, which is used to measure the movement and feed back to the PZT actuator controller, so that a positioning accuracy of a few nanometres becomes possible, (c) a pair of linear bearing guide for guiding the movement and guaranteeing the stiffness of the system, (d) a quartz force link for measuring the real time machining force, and (e) control systems for the above actions. The paper discusses the functions of all the parts and demonstrates the design considerations for achieving the high precision and stiffness at the same time. The system is an integrated module and can be used in machine tools for micro/nano-cutting, grinding, polishing, or measurement devices.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0065,[]
"SIMILARITY AND DIFFERENCE: DAMAGE IN SILICON CAUSED BY INDENTATION, SCRATCHING, GRINDING AND POLISHING","The similarity and difference in subsurface structure of monocrystalline silicon after indentation, scratching, grinding and polishing have been studied with the aid of the cross-section view technique and transmission electron microscopy. It has been found that all the processes bring about phase transformation. However, the type and extent of phase transformation and the generation of dislocations or planar defects under the transformation zone depend on the type of processes. It was also shown that microcracks are initiated at the sites of defect or dislocation intersection. The principle of the similarity and difference in subsurface structure is discussed by considering the stress and temperature fields induced by individual finishing processes.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0059,[]
MACHINING DAMAGE IN UNIDIRECTIONAL FIBRE-REINFORCED PLASTICS,"This paper aims to characterise the machining damage in epoxy composites reinforced by unidirectional carbon fibres when subjected to single-point cutting with different rake angles. It is expected that the understanding achieved will offer insight into multipoint cutting, such as grinding. The degree of damage of a machined surface was determined by examining its surface and subsurface. The effect of rake angle of cutting tools was studied against fibre orientation, cutting force, depth of cut, surface roughness and subsurface damage. A wide range of rake angle from -20° to 40° was employed in the investigation. It was found that cracking under machined surfaces was dependent on the cutting depth and fibre orientation. The study offered a deeper understanding of the mechanism of damage and provided a useful guideline for the design of FRP machining.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0058,[]

AN ATTEMPT OF DRY ICE JET COOLANT IN CBN GRINDING,"This paper deals with the usage of dry ice grains jet of -80°C instead of conventional fluid as cooling material in grinding process for the purpose of solving the problems, such as environmental pollution, caused by the fluid coolant. Grinding experiments using a resinoid cBN wheel show that normal grinding force in grinding with the dry ice coolant is a little higher than that in grinding with the fluid coolant, but, by using the dry ice grains jet together with MQL, the grinding force decreases by nearly 20%.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0054,[]
APPLICATION OF OIL-MIST LUBRICATION TO HIGH-SPEED MILLING,"Oil-mist lubrication system supplies very small quantity of oil with compressed air to end mill from a nozzle. Vegetable oil without any harmful substance is used in this paper. Thus troubles such as environmental pollution or deterioration of working environment caused by using large amount of cutting fluid are hardly caused by using this lubrication method. In this paper, this oil-mist lubrication is applied to high-speed milling of S45C steel, in which cutting speed is over 2000 m/min. Then the effects of its lubrication on tool wear are discussed. As a result of cutting tests, by using proposed oil-mist lubrication, tool wear becomes small compared with the case of no lubrication if cutting speed is lower than 750 m/min under the settled cutting conditions. It was also cleared that oil-mist supplying position affects tool wear. Tool life becomes longest when oil-mist is supplied at the disengage point in milling. And tool wear suppression effect of oil-mist become larger if the quantity of supplied oil increases up to 0.5cc/min.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0052,[]
SIMULATION ANALYSIS OF HYPER VELOCITY MACHINING,"A dynamic and explicit scheme of thermo-elastic-plastic finite element analysis is developed to investigate the phenomena in hyper velocity metal cutting processes. When the cutting speed exceeds the velocity of the plastic waves, a shock wave is generated. Due to the shock wave, high compressive hydrostatic stresses occur ahead of the rake face. High levels of compressive hydrostatic stress may cause brittle fracture of the tool. Hence hyper velocity machining is limited by the velocity of the plastic waves. This fact should be taken into consideration in the design of machine tool and cutting tools for high-speed machining.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0051,[]

STOCHASTIC FRACTURE CHARACTERISTICS OF ADVANCED CERAMIC CUTTING TOOLS,"The stochastic characteristics of ceramic tool mechanical properties have an important effect on a tool's stochastic fracture characteristics. In this paper, these tool stochastic characteristics and their relationship to tool fracture are studied using a reliability theory. It is found that the stochastic characteristics of tool mechanical properties and the tool fracture obey Weibull distributions. The fracture probability of cutting tool caused by the interfacial bonding strength and the other mechanical properties are different. The tool fracture probability caused by mechanical load is higher than that by thermal load or mechanical-thermal load in milling operations. It is shown that the stochastic fracture characteristics of the ceramic tool is caused by the synthetic action of the stochastic characteristics of tool mechanical properties including interfacial bonding strength.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0048,[]
ANALYSES OF GRINDING FORCE CHARACTERISTICS ON HIGH SPEED CREEP FEED GRINDING TUNGSTEN CARBIDES,"This paper investigates grinding forces, grain states and chips in creep feed grinding tungsten carbides by using a resinoid bonded diamond wheel in grinding speeds up to 80 m/s. Experimental results indicate there is a tendency that grinding forces increase as grinding speeds increase. Through SEM observations of diamond grains, chips and work-piece surfaces, it was found that chips are easily cohered and detained at grains cutting edges and results in grain cutting edges becoming blunt and hardly cutting-in. This indicates the possibility of the cohered chips increasing grinding forces.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0047,[]
A DISCUSSION ON THE MODELLING OF GRINDING AND POLISHING,"This paper discusses some problems of modelling in polishing and grinding. The issues were addressed through examples of the finite element analysis of grinding, dimensional analysis of polishing and characterisation of non-linear deformation in mono-crystalline silicon due to grinding, polishing and indentation. It showed that modelling of polishing and grinding can be carried out by various means but is still an open problem in general in terms of quantitative and reliable predictions.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0044,[]
NEW DIRECTIONS FOR ABRASIVE FLOW MACHINING,"Abrasive flow machining (AFM) is used to deburr, polish or radius surfaces and edges by flowing a semisolid abrasive media over these areas. The AFM process can be used in a wide range of finishing operations: it can process many areas on a single workpiece or multiple parts simultaneously; inaccessible areas and complex internal passages can be finished economically and productively; automatic systems can handle thousands of parts per day, greatly reducing labor costs by eliminating tedious hand work. Orbital abrasive flow machining (orbital polishing) is an emerging hybrid technology that combines abrasive flow machining and orbital grinding. This combination provides a technology that can uniformly remove material from virtually any complex-shaped component to achieve burr removal, radiusing or surface finish improvement.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0043,[]
FEASIBILITY STUDY OF USING CAVITATION TO INCREASE EROSION IN PARTICULATE-LADEN WATER JET CUTTING DEVICES,"Conventional jet-cutting devices rely on high-velocity water slurry jets, which cause high equipment erosion and heavy maintenance. In this paper the feasibility of using cavitation to enhance the jet-cutting process is examined. It is qualitatively demonstrated that when cavitation is introduced into a low velocity particle laden flow the erosion rate of target material is increased by several orders of magnitude. In contrast to cavitation erosion, the surface finish of the eroded material is very smooth. This, together with the fact that low velocities can be used, indicates that the process is suitable for use in jet-cutting devices.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0042,[]
DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ABRASIVE JET MACHINING DEVICE,"A new abrasive jet machining (AJM) device has been developed for precise etching and patterning of hard and brittle materials, such as ceramics, glass and silicon. However, since conventional AJM device cannot control precisely the amount of blasting abrasives, applying this method to precision machining has been difficult. Moreover, in the machining of small holes, colliding abrasives accumulate in the bottom of the hole, preventing the direct impact of successive abrasives onto the workpiece. As a result, the machining efficiency decreases as the machining progresses. In the present paper, the machining characteristics of the new AJM device are investigated, and direct etching and patterning of glass without masking are demonstrated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0041,[]
DEBURRING CHARACTERISTICS BY UTILIZING DRY CENTRIFUGAL BARREL FINISHING,"The influences of media charging ratio on deburring of workpieces have been experimentally investigated in dry centrifugal barrel finishing. The media used in this investigation is the one made from nylon mixed with abrasive grains for dry barrel finishing. The workpiece is a sliced cold-finished bar of plain carbon steel(S45C in JIS). It is 32mm in diameter and machined to 10mm in thickness by face turning. Burrs of the three different heights and the same thickness are formed on workpiece edges by choosing depth of cut and feed rate in face turning. On deburring, edge parts of workpieces are observed under the microscope and measured with the profile measuring machine. The stock removal and surface roughness of workpieces are also measured with electronic balance and the surface measuring machine. The finishing time for deburring is defined as a time which the burr height measured with the profile measuring machine takes to decrease to zero. The results of observation and measurement of workpieces show that the finishing time for deburring increases with the media charging ratio and that the two types of deburring process exist in dry centrifugal barrel finishing.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0040,[]
EDGE FINISHING OF PRODUCTS WITH COMPLEX-SHAPE BY MAGNETIC ABRASIVE MACHINING,"We report the results of finishing technology using grit or cut-wireshot as magnetic abrasives [1]. This is applicable for simple shapes such as plates and cylindrical parts but not complex-shape products. In this study, we suggest a new finishing method applicable for complex-shape products such as products assembled from several bent parts. With the method, a magnetic circuit is composed of a pair of parallel steel disks, and the side surfaces of the right and left disks are positioned opposite each other. A characteristic point is that a multi-layer disk is used as the magnetic pole and the right and left disks are offset in the direction of the central axis of the disks. This therefore offsets the magnetic brush formed between right and left plates. The method was confirmed to be practically applicable by actual edge finishing tests using a product assembled from three plates with long slots. The edges of the slot of all the plates could be finished to a round edge. The influence of the finishing conditions on the surface quality was also investigated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0038,[]
ON MACHINE FLUID-FREE ELECTRODISCHARGE TRUEING/DRESSING METHOD FOR SUPERABRASIVE WHEELS,"This paper describes a fluid-free electrodischarge trueing/dressing method which does not use water soluble grinding fluid to solve problems caused by using grinding fluid. Various kinds of electrodischarging atmospheres, such as mist, dry, compressed air and cold air instead of conventional grinding fluid, were applied to electrodischarge trueing/dressing for metal bonded superabrasive wheels and electrically conductive resinoid superabrasive wheels on a grinding machine. Even if grinding fluid was not used, elimination of wheel run out and forming of a complicated profile on a wheel was possible with this method. Moreover. grinding experiment showed that wheels which was ED trued and dressed in cold air atmosphere showed the same grinding force and less wheel wear compared with wheels dressed with a conventional WA stick stone.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0037,[]

Through the consecutive circular motions and down feeds, their profiles are formed into a round shape. In this paper, appropriateness of this method is experimentally investigated by using the CNC surface grinding machine. Grinding wheels can be precisely round-off trued by the proposed method regardless of the combination of abrasive materials and size of the stick. Necessary number of truing passes to obtain the settled radius changes with combination of the stick and the wheel -material and size of the stick.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0036,[]
THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION OF A NEW ROUND-OFF TRUING METHOD,"A new round-off truing method is proposed to precisely fonn a grinding wheel of toroidal shape. In this method, a grinding wheel is circularly moved around an abrasive stick using the circular interpolation of a CNC machine. During the consecutive circular motions and down feeds, the wheel and the stick grind each other and their profiles are gradually fonned into a round shape. In this paper, an appropriateness of this method is investigated through the computer simulation. The curvature radius settles a certain value which can be geometrically expected. The wear ratio of the abrasives hardly influences the settled radius. Proposed truing method can be applied to the precision round-off truing regardless of the composition of the abrasives and size of the stick.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0035,[]
DEVELOPMENT OF A PRECISION TRUING TECHNIQUE FOR A CBN GRINDING WHEEL OF SMALL DIAMETER,"In order to realize precision truing of a CBN grinding wheel of small diameter, a truing technique, in which the grinding wheel axial profile is an envelope formed by circular arcs, has been proposed. The truing equipment developed for the purpose of internal grinding consists of a rotary GC abrasive cup wheel or truer and a vertical guide which enables up-and-down motion of the truer. The rotating shaft of the truer is tilted downward so that the part of the truer section which contacts with the CBN grinding wheel traces a circular arc. A radial depth of cut is given to the grinding wheel at every descent of the truer and a straight-line envelope can be generated as the grinding wheel profile by shifting the truer in the transverse direction at periodic intervals. The truing method was applied to a vitrified CBN # 120 grinding quill of 5 mm diameter and it was confirmed that a wheel axial profile having a flatness of less than 0.5 micrometer can be obtained under the truing conditions which give a theoretical flatness of 0.26 micrometer.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0034,[]

All polishing fluids more greatly improved the polishing characteristics of titanium materials than tap water only. In particular, the introduction of fatty acid into the polishing fluids was better in the cases of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-15V-3Cr-3Al-3Sn.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTELLIGENT CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING (CMP) SYSTEM,"Current conventional CMP has problems for erosion and dishing for copper damascene. The Intelligent CMP offers global planarization and local polishing to reduce erosion and dishing, as both wafer and polishing pad are rotated at high speed. It will be mentioned why high speed has advantage over low speed. One of the problems of conventional CMP is slurry cost. Because only a few percent of slurry fed works to a wafer. Therefore we have reduced it, by delivering the slurry at point of use. The Intelligent CMP processes the wafer with its front side up, and the polishing pad does not cover the entire wafers, which makes the in-situation measurement possible. The Intelligent CMP offers automatic pad replacement, to achieve continuous polishing without stopping the machine to replace the pads. The Intelligent CMP offers a 3 step polishing to achieve atomic scale removal balancing with mechanical-chemical-electrical effect. In addition, the performance of copper CMP such as removal ratio, erosion, dishing and pattern density will be presented.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0028,[]

In this work, the novel process using pre-thin-surface grinding and CMP for highly efficient planarization will be proposed. Patterned inter-layer-dielectric(ILD) film surface is ground or scratched with a thin diamond disk wheel. Since the surface has some roughed texture and is chemically activated through storing strain energy, the pre-thin-surface ground ILD film will be selectively polished and superior planarization for the protruding part will be completed by following conventional CMP. Practically, 2mm-square to 5mm-square patterned ILD which previously could not be planarized with conventional CMP process were perfectly planarized using the new process.

DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF FIXED ABRASIVE POLISHING UTILIZING SMALL GRINDING TOOLS WITH ELID FOR ASPHERIC OPTICAL SURFACES,"As use of aspheric elements has enabled opticians to fabricate optical systems with high performance, lightweight and compact size, the application of aspheric elements has been increasing rapidly in the recent years. The development of techniques for fabricating qualified products at a lower cost has thus become an urgent and challenging task to manufacturers. Like spherical and other optical elements, aspheric elements require both accurate figure and smooth surface simultaneously, but the changing curvature radius makes it impossible to apply the conventional global polishing method used for spherical elements. Usually the combination of loose abrasive polishing with an elastic polisher and compensation machining with a subaperture tool is employed in the final process and has been proved to be effective, but its low efficiency increases the costs of aspheric elements. Though use of computer as a controller has improved efficiency considerably and eliminates the need to depend on human skills, there are still limits imposed by loose abrasive polishing. Further advancements should therefore be made. In our research, metal-resin bonded diamond wheel was employed as tool for fixed abrasive polishing. By the application of electrolytic interval dressing, very smooth surface with a roughness of l.0-1.6nmRa, 1.2-2.0nmRq was obtained for an aspheric surface made of BK7.

A STUDY OF SMOOTH SURFACE FINISH BY ELID-LAP GRINDING AND METAL-RESIN BONDED WHEEL,"As the high-tech devices supporting the current information-oriented age grow increasingly high performance and compact over the recent years, demands are also growing stronger for better surface finish and higher accuracy in the optical and electrical parts which make up these devices. To answer to such needs, the authors have proposed ELID lap grinding, which is a constant pressure grinding method employing the ELID technique, and are carrying out studies to realize efficient and highly accurate machining. To upgrade the surface roughness of the workpieces ground, the authors propose a grinding method, in which the workpiece is ground together with a harder material. In this study, to improve the grinding quality of silicon, cemented carbide was used as the harder material and the grinding characteristics were studied. When silicon was ground together with cemented carbide, surface roughness improved compared to when ground alone, but the removal rate was lower, and more or less the same as that of the cemented carbide. The experimental results confirmed that this method is useful for obtaining better surface qualities.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0019,[]

EFFECT OF CONTACT LENGTH IN OFF-ROUND GRINDING,"Punch grinding, a particular form of off-round grinding was investigated for the effect of contact length. The geometrical analysis of the contact length showed that the contact length in punch grinding is over three times that of an equivalent sized round component in cylindrical grinding. An increase in the punch grinding contact length leads to an increased threshold for onset of thermal damage. An increase in the contact length also leads to an increase in the normal force. An increase in material removal rate, as a consequence of the need for a lower process cycle time, is best achieved by an increase in the punch rotational speed, rather than by an increase in the depth of cut. Results showed that even though an increase in the contact length resulted in an increase in the process heat input into the workpiece, a larger proportion is dissipated over the larger contact area. ie, on balance, the effect of the contact length in off-round grinding is beneficial.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0017,[]

High surface finish using conventional machining methods can be achieved in three steps (preliminary and final grinding followed by polishing). For these purposes special grinding and polishing heads are used, which are installed on a lathe. Finishing operations are highly labour and time consuming. In this paper the design of a special grinding head is discussed as well as its mathematical model, which enabled the investigation of the influence of the head kinematics on the lay pattern of machined surface. This head allows combining final grinding and polishing and, thus, achieving significant savings.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0014,[]
ROBOTIC GRINDING USING SUSPENSION SYSTEM,"A new automated grinding system is described, using a low powered direct-drive robot arm with a suspension device. To enable the precise grinding system by low powered robot arm in vertical plane, Suspended Robot Grinding System (SRGS) has been developed. This paper presents a low powered suspended robot arm for chamfering operation in industrial plants. SRGS provides many advantages compared to the conventional grinding system in vertical plane. It provides a necessary compensation force against the gravity force and reduces the joint friction. By increasing the suspending force, heavy tool can be manipulated. In order to verifY the feasibility of the system, simulations and experiments have been carried out.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0013,[]
GRINDING CHARACTERISTICS OF MICRO TENSILE TEST PIECE GROUND BY FORM EXTERNAL GRINDING,"Form accuracy, surface roughness and tensile rupture elongation of the micro test piece produced was examined in order to investigate the influence of machined surface properties on specific strength. High-speed steel, brass, stainless steel, and tungsten carbide were selected for test piece material. The shape of the test piece was 50 μ m in diameter, 1.5mm in the length of its parallel portion, and 1.0mm in the gauge length. The grinding style was plunge and dry cut with a form wheel by open side support. The wheels were SD400, SD600, SD800 and SD1000 bronze-bonded wheels, which were generated by spark erosion. The diameter of the parallel portion increased as the measuring portion diverged from the chucking point. As well, the diameter of the parallel portion of the test piece of each material was not the 50 μ m goal dimension but rather 80 μ m~160 μ m. As grain size was large, the surface property of the test piece was somewhat rough. Simple tensile rupture machining was used to investigate rupture point and elongation. Each test piece ruptured at both the narrow and rough points.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0011,[]
FABRICATION OF METAL-BONDED GRINDING/POLISHING TOOLS BY THE GREENTAPE LASER SINTERING METHOD,The present paper proposes a new methodology of fabricating metal-bonded grinding/polishing tools by the greentape laser sintering method. The porosity of copper sintered parts is utilised for manufacturing grinding/polishing tools containing cubic boron nitride (CBN) or alumina abrasives. The feasibility investigation shows that a mirror surface is achieved in polishing austenitic steel with a copper-bonded CBN tool.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0010,[]

EVALUATION OF GRINDABILITY OF CEMENTED CARBIDE FOR REALIZATION OF PRECISION AND EFFICIENT GRINDING,"The grindability of cemented carbide is evaluated by grinding ratio, grinding force and ground surface roughness in surface plunge grinding by resin bonded diamond wheel. Main results obtained are as follows; (l)the grinding ratio is increased with the increase of grain size and peripheral wheel speed, and the grinding ratio is increased with the decrease of the wheel depth of cut and the work speed; (2)the grinding force increases with the increase of the wheel depth of cut and the work speed, and the force decreases with the increase of the grain size and the peripheral wheel speed; (3)the ground surface roughness decreases with the inrease of the peripheral wheel speed, and the surface roughness decreases with decrease of the grain size, wheel depth of cut and work speed;(4)these grinding conditions are closely related with the grain depth of cut, and the decrease of the grain depth of cut brings about the increase of the grinding ratio, the decrease of the grinding force and the surface roughness; (5)the precision and efficient grinding of cemented carbide is realizable by the control of the grain depth of cut.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0008,[]
ABRASIVE CAPACITY OF THIN FILM DIAMOND STRUCTURES,"Diamond structures were produced with a three-step replication technique. First a mould is created using standard silicon wafer patterning technology. Diamond was then deposited in a CVD process onto the mould surface. The last step is to electroplate a nickel backing on the diamond film and remove the silicon mould. Using this technique, diamond pyramids of different size and lateral distribution were produced. The wear rates of brass, steel, aluminium oxide and silicon nitride caused by the diamond structures were compared with that of commercial silicon carbide grinding paper in a pin-on-disc configuration. The diamond pyramids abraded with a much higher rate than the silicon carbide grinding paper on all materials except brass. This was especially pronounced for aluminium oxide.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0006,[]
THE GRINDABILITY OF STAINLESS STEEL USING ULID (ULTRASONIC IN-PROCESS DRESSING) METHOD,"Because of the high toughness and low thermal conductivity, stainless steel is very difficult material to machine. It is also reported that the chemical interaction between stainless steel workpiece and alumina wheel causes the poor grindability. From these reasons, grinding time is larger and form accuracy is worse when the material ground with alumina wheel.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0003,[]
AN EXPLICIT FINITE ELEMENT FORMULATION FOR COUPLED DEFORMATION ANALYSIS DUE TO SURFACE GRINDING,"When an alloy steel experiences a critical grinding condition, irreversible deformation caused by mechanical loading, thermal loading and micro-structural phase transformation couples with strong non-linearity. This paper presents an algorithm to analyze the residual stresses induced by the full coupling of all the above causes involving significant temperature- and microstructure-dependent property changes of workpiece materials. User-supplied subroutines to an existing FEM code were developed to simulate the coupled effect at the resolution of integration points. Results showed that the algorithm is quite efficient and stable in dealing with the non-linearity in grinding induced deformation.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812817822_0002,[]
