POLYAKOV CONJECTURE AND 2+1 DIMENSIONAL GRAVITY,"After briefly reviewing the hamiltonian approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity in absence of matter on closed universes, we consider 2+1 dimensional gravity coupled to point particles in an open universe. We show that the hamiltonian structure of the theory is the result of a conjecture put forward by Polyakov in a different context. A proof is given of such a conjecture. Finally we give the exact quantization of the two particle problem in open space.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0026,[]
PHYSICS WITH LARGE EXTRA DIMENSIONS,"A theory with such a mathematical beauty cannot be wrong: this was one of the main arguments in favor of string theory, which unifies all known physical theories of fundamental interactions in a single coherent description of the universe. But no one has ever observed strings, not even indirectly, neither the space of extra dimensions where they live. However, there is a hope that the “hidden” dimensions of string theory are much larger than what we thought in the past and they become within experimental reach in the near future, together with the strings themselves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0025,[]
String Theory and M-Theory,"This chapter presents an overview of string theory and M-theory. It introduces the basic concepts together with a brief history of how the subject was developed. Although string theory was initially viewed as a radical alternative to quantum field theory, more recent discoveries make it clear that it is actually the logical completion of quantum field theory, and therefore it is not radical at all. The chapter also describes various approaches that are used in the ongoing attempts to account for particle physics phenomenology, and it addresses the question of how predictive the theory is likely to be…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0019,[]
Lattice Gauge Theory and the Origin of Mass,"Most of the mass of everyday objects resides in atomic nuclei; the total of the electrons’ mass adds up to less than one part in a thousand. The nuclei are composed of nucleons — protons and neutrons — whose nuclear binding energy, though tremendous on a human scale, is small compared to their rest energy. The nucleons are, in turn, composites of massless gluons and nearly massless quarks. It is the energy of these confined objects, via ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0018,[]

16: The Singapore Indian Community towards SG100,"The story of Indian Singaporeans in the next 50 years begins on the high note struck 50 years ago. Singapore’s founding fathers envisaged an integral national role for them born of rights and not sufferance. The enshrinement of Tamil as one of the four official languages was a reminder to all Singaporeans that Indians had an acknowledged place in the national scheme of things. To Indians, the message was that they would need to think and behave as Singaporeans first and last. Certainly, the ancestral part of their national identity was an important component of their personal and social consciousness, but ethnicity was not destiny: nationalism was and would be. Fifty years from 1965, Indian Singaporean children enjoy a confidence that is no less than that felt by children from other races, although Indians are Singapore’s second minority. Indeed, one of Singapore’s greatest achievements is that minority status confers protection, but does not invoke insecurity. From the protection of Tamil to the attempt to ensure minority representation in Parliament through the Group Representation Constituencies scheme, being from a minority community has its advantages. This is no small matter given the ways in which minorities elsewhere are sometimes turned into scapegoats for all that goes wrong with the national direction set by a jealous majority. Singapore must preserve this multiracial status quo into the next half-century…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0016,[]
15: The History of Parsis in Singapore,"Singapore was a Crown Colony founded by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 and was used as a criminal settlement for the Indian convicts. The first Parsi in Singapore unfortunately was a convict by the name of Muncherjee. When he fell seriously ill in 1829, an Armenian, Aristarcus Sarkies, persuaded the Parsis in China to buy a burial place for Zoroastrians/Parsis in Singapore. A plot of land was bought in what is today the most prestigious banking area of Shenton Way from funds raised by Hong Kong Parsi traders. In 1848, more land was bought adjacent to it in order to build a bungalow as a Parsi Lodge for Parsi traders from China to rest and hold Zoroastrian religious ceremonies. In fact, Mr. Cawasji Shapoorji was the first Parsi to reside in the region in Penang in Malaysia, much before the convict Muncherjee in Singapore. His name is on the records of Lodge Napier No. 441 in 1832. There was also a Parsi burial ground, but no records are available…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0015,[]
14: Pakistanis in Singapore,"In 1947, when India was carved up in order to make Pakistan, millions who moved across the new dividing line are now called Indians. In 1971, when East Pakistan seceded to become Bangladesh, millions of former Pakistanis became Bangladeshis. The land of what is now Pakistan has lived through two bloody and bitter ‘partitions’ and we should honour those who belonged to those lands of pre-Partition India and contributed to independent Singapore, regardless of what they are labelled as now…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0014,[]

Some of them are not with us today, but their contributions continue to benefit us. Others who are still with us continue to make significant contributions nationally and internationally in their respective fields of interest. We have political leaders, social activists, civil servants, social workers, community leaders, administrators, artists, doctors, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, journalists, athletes and many others who have proved that, despite all the odds being stacked against them, they can equal anyone else in every way. They have made a difference, enjoyed the support of their families and many have raised daughters and sons who have and still are contributing to Singapore’s economy and society…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0013,[]

9: Indian Political Participation in Singapore,"Indian political participation in Singapore goes far back into the city’s colonial history. However, it was cast in sharp relief following Japan’s defeat in World War II. Although the Indian National Army (INA) had failed to liberate India with Japan’s help, the struggle for India’s independence unleashed a burst of insurgent energy among Indians in Singapore and Malaya. That radicalism proved to be resilient when it planted its roots in local soil. Singapore Indians turned their attention away from their role in India’s independence to the anti-colonial struggle against the British returning to their own region…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0009,[]
8: Indian Writing in English,"The majority of the resident Indian community in Singapore is of South Indian origin, particularly of Tamil ancestry. Early settlers, many of whom were indentured labourers, brought with them to Singapore their traditions, languages and a strong sense of culture. In Singapore, Indian writers, using both English and in the vernacular, have developed the genres of poetry, drama and the short story to particular relevance, and these literary forms still remain more popular than the genre of the novel. Yet, the pool of Indian writing in English as compared to the body of writing in the vernacular is small. A portion of Tamil writing is translated into English, but few Tamil writers write directly in the English language, and translations are not considered in this short assessment…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0008,[]
7: ‘Rising from the Ashes’: The Development of Hindi in Independent Singapore,"Hindi has always had a tentative position in Singapore’s multicultural setting. In the public sphere, initially Malay, and now English, serves as the lingua franca for inter-ethnic communication. Even in the Indian community in Singapore, Hindi speakers comprise a ‘minority within a minority’ — a corollary of large-scale immigration from southern India historically, which ensured that Tamil speakers constituted the largest component of the Indian population here. Consequently, for much of Singapore‘s history, interaction in Hindi tended to be confined to “the domains of the home, for interaction with relatives … [co-ethnic] friends, and for community related uses.” That said, over the last 25 years, Hindi has emerged as the fastest-growing Indian language in Singapore, and its visibility in the public sphere now extends well beyond just the Hindi-speaking community. This chapter historicises the changing position of the Hindi language in Singapore, with a focus on developments after independence in 1965. In so doing, the chapter examines the historical development of the language in Singapore to provide context; it explains how specifi c policies adopted by the state after 1965 resulted in the near attrition of the language in the city by the late 1980s; and goes on to analyse why the language has, metaphorically, ‘risen from the ashes’ to its current position of strength.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0007,[]
6: Fifty Years of Singapore Tamil Literature,"At the time of Singapore’s separation from Malaysia in 1965, owing to the colonial past, a cultural gulf existed between English-educated Tamils and predominantly Tamil-using Tamils. Tamil literature was left to the latter to be fostered as part of their Tamil language efforts. Becoming and being a literati has been the ideal among them. This ideal was rooted in the late colonial period and fully developed in the post-colonial years in Tamil Nadu, Malaya and Singapore. Most writers were lowincome earners associated with working-class Tamils. Most of them were unschooled and worked as daily rated labourers, hair-dressers, road laying coolies, port workers, Tamil school teachers and some were even unemployed. Their asset was their high aspiration to be recognised as a writer. This passion drove them to self-educate themselves in the art of writing grammatically structured poetry, short stories and novels and become eloquent public speakers. Amongst the Tamil writers of that era, those who worked at the radio stations and newspapers or at the ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813140592_0006,[]

Grain Mountains and Hungry Millions ,"NR:While there is sufficient food production now, we find that inequalities have increased between the rural and urban. Many small and marginal farmers are forced to migrate to the towns to earn a living as rickshaw pullers or other manual workers. Santals and other tribal groups from Jharkhand work as agricultural labour in the sugar cane fields of western Uttar Pradesh, or in the construction of border roads, year after year, despite owning land at home. Extension services elude them; they are not seen as motivated because they are unable to pay the costs of transportation to travel for extension meetings and demonstrations.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0039,[]

Fighting Hunger ,"The World Food Summit (WFS) convened by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome in 1996 resolved to bring down the number of hungry and malnourished from 816 million in 1990-1992 to 408 million by 2015. This involves reducing the number of undernourished people by 22 million every year. In 2002, a meeting of Heads of States and Governments and Ministers for Agriculture was convened by the FAO in Rome from June 10-13, to review the progress made since 1996 in achieving the targets set at the WFS.

WHAT IF GREEN REVOLUTION WAS ABSENT IN 1960s?,"From the historical data of the post independent India, with special reference to agriculture and food scenario, it was evident that early 1960s had bad years due to drought which adversely affected food production. Even for the then population of around 450 million, food availability was a serious problem and the fear of people going without food was bothering the minds of the Prime Minister, Agriculture Minster and officials. At that time, the country was depending on the US based PL 480 scheme to import food grains to meet the demand of public. That period was literally ‘ship to mouth’ existence, meaning whatever was shipped from USA was enough just to feed, with no stock to face problems of poverty staring at the country. If the problem had prevailed for long, starvation and hunger deaths would have been the worst possible scenario. That was the most challenging period. Some misconceptions need to be corrected.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0031,[]

2014 International Year of Family Farming: a boost to evergreen revolution,"The evergreen revolution aims at achieving productivity in perpetuity without accompanying ecological and social harm. The smallholder family farms with pro-nature, pro-poor and pro-women orientation provide a boost to the evergreen revolution. Revitalization of family farming traditions with emphasis on the empowerment of women and youth will enhance small farm productivity and profitability on the one hand, and nutrition-sensitive agriculture on the other. Family farms enhance the rural livelihoods. Corporate farming displaces three to four jobs for every single job created. Monocropping largely practiced by the corporate farms is not conducive to develop strategies to provide agricultural remedies to nutritional maladies in different agro-ecological regions.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0028,[]
Zero hunger,"The United Nations (UN) designated 2014 as the International Year of Family Farming, recognizing that an estimated 500 million family farms, involving over 2 billion people, play a key role in food production and consumption worldwide. It is thus an opportune time to encourage a shift in tackling global hunger—from a “food security” focus to an agenda that promotes “nutrition security” instead. The drive to reduce hunger in the world has largely relied on crops such as wheat and rice that provide calories. But an increase in calories alone is not good enough. Improved diets and good health require bolstering nutrition…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0027,[]
Food production & availability - Essential prerequisites for sustainable food security,"Food and nutrition security are intimately interconnected, since only a food based approach can help in overcoming malnutrition in an economically and socially sustainable manner. Food production provides the base for food security as it is a key determinant of food availability. This paper deals with different aspects of ensuring high productivity and production without associated ecological harm for ensuring adequate food availability. By mainstreaming ecological considerations in technology development and dissemination, we can enter an era of evergreen revolution and sustainable food and nutrition security. Public policy support is crucial for enabling this.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0025,[]

FORTY YEARS OF FREEDOM: PROGRESS ON THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL FRONTS,"The 40th anniversary of our independence is a good occasion both to look back and forward. Looking back, there can be nothing but pride in the achievements of our farmers. Progress has been good in achieving self-sufficiency in statistical terms both with reference to major staples and industrial raw materials like cotton and sugarcane (Table 1). However, statistical food self-sufficiency does not imply the elimination of hunger, which now co-exists on a fairly large scale with food grain surpluses. This is why FAO has defined food security as “",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0014,[]

Building A National Food Security System,"At the “Donyi-Polo” temple at Along in Arunachal Pradesh, there is a portrait of a woman who is bolieved to have been the first person to have cultivated rice. The early domestication of plants over 10,000 years ago started two significant developments. First, various forms of energy (collectively termed “cultural energy”) were introduced to enable green plants to give stable and higher yields. Secondly, from the millions of species of world flora and fauna, only a few plants and animals were chosen for domestication. There are now only about 30 plant species whose individual world production exceeds 10 million tonnes per year and 6 animal species whose production in the form of meat exceeds 1 million tonnes per year. Such dependence on a few species has increased the vulnerability of food production systems to weather aberrations and pest epidemics. Compounding this problem of dependence is the fact that at present less than 10 countries in the world have surplus food grains for the export market. In recent years steps have been initiated to develop global and national food security systems. I would like to discuss briefly some aspects of a national food security system further. Some of the major components of an effective national food security system are: (",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0012,[]

The Evolution and Significance of JOUNTI SEED VILLAGE,"During the last few years we have been witnessing a rapid shift from a static to a scientific agriculture in our country. This shift gained greatly in momentum during 1967, since favourable weather conditions and high price levels provided conditions conducive to creating the motivation necessary for maximising farm production. The catalyst in this “New Frontiers’ Movement” in our agriculture is the high yielding variety. The dramatic increase in yield and income which the new varieties of rice and wheat and hybrids of jowar, bajra and maize bring about, when they are grown with adequate quantities of fertilizers and other inputs, has helped to raise the sights of the farming community and has led to the interest now evident in the seeds of new strains…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813200074_0006,[]

THE TWISTOR APPROACH TO SPACE-TIME STRUCTURES,"An outline of twistor theory is presented. Initial motivations (from 1963) are given for this type of non-local geometry, as an intended scheme for unifying quantum theory and space-time structure. Basic twistor geometry and algebra is exhibited, and it is shown that this provides a complex-manifold description of classical (spinning) massless particles. Simple quantum commutation rules lead to a concise representation of massless particle wavefunctions, in terms of contour integrals or (more profoundly) holomorphic 1st cohomology. Non-linear versions give elegant representations of anti-self-dual Einstein (or Yang-Mills) fields, describing left-handed non-linear gravitons (or Yang-Mills particles). A brief outline of the current status of the ‘googly problem’ is provided, whereby the right-handed particles would also be incorporated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0017,[]

CONSISTENT DISCRETE SPACE-TIME,"We review recent efforts to construct gravitational theories on discrete space-times, usually referred to as the “consistent discretization” approach. The resulting theories are free of constraints at the canonical level and therefore allow to tackle many problems that cannot be currently addressed in continuum quantum gravity. In particular the theories imply a natural method for resolving the big bang (and other types) of singularities and predict a fundamental mechanism for decoherence of quantum states that might be relevant to the black hole information paradox. At a classical level, the theories may provide an attractive new path for the exploration of issues in numerical relativity. Finally, the theories can make direct contact with several kinematical results of continuum loop quantum gravity. We review in broad terms several of these results and present in detail as an illustration the classical treatment with this technique of the simple yet conceptually challenging model of two oscillators with constant energy sum.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0015,[]
LOOP QUANTUM COSMOLOGY,"The expansion of our universe, when followed backward in time, implies that it emerged from a phase of huge density, the big bang. These stages are so extreme that classical general relativity combined with matter theories is not able to describe them properly, and one has to refer to quantum gravity. A complete quantization of gravity has not yet been developed, but there are many results about key properties to be expected. When applied to cosmology, a consistent picture of the early universe arises which is free of the classical pathologies and has implications for the generation of structure which are potentially observable in the near future.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0014,[]
QUANTUM GEOMETRY AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS,"The goal of this article is to present a broad perspective on loop quantum gravity, a non-perturbative, background independent approach to the problem of unification of general relativity and quantum physics, based on a specific theory of quantum Riemannian geometry. The chapter is addressed to non-experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on underlying ideas, conceptual issues and the overall status of the program rather than mathematical details and associated technical subtleties.

SPACETIME IN SEMICLASSICAL GRAVITY,"This article will summarize selected aspects of the semiclassical theory of gravity, which involves a classical gravitational field coupled to quantum matter fields. Among the issues which will be discussed are the role of quantum effects in black hole physics and in cosmology, the effects of quantum violations of the classical energy conditions, and inequalities which constrain the extent of such violations. We will also examine the first steps beyond semiclassical gravity, when the effects of spacetime geometry fluctuations start to appear.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0011,[]

WAS EINSTEIN RIGHT?: TESTING RELATIVITY AT THE CENTENARY,"We review the experimental evidence for Einstein's special and general relativity. A variety of high precision null experiments verify the weak equivalence principle and local Lorentz invariance, while gravitational redshift and other clock experiments support local position invariance. Together these results confirm the Einstein Equivalence Principle which underlies the concept that gravitation is synonymous with spacetime geometry, and must be described by a metric theory. Solar system experiments that test the weak-field, post-Newtonian limit of metric theories strongly favor general relativity. The Binary Pulsar provides tests of gravitational-wave damping and of strong-field general relativity. Recently discovered binary pulsar systems may provide additional tests. Future and ongoing experiments, such as the Gravity Probe B Gyroscope Experiment, satellite tests of the Equivalence principle, and tests of gravity at short distance to look for extra spatial dimensions could constrain extensions of general relativity. Laser interferometric gravitational-wave observatories on Earth and in space may provide new tests of gravitational theory via detailed measurements of the properties of gravitational waves.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0008,[]

PROBING SPACE-TIME THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS,Einstein's equations describe gravity using an elegant but complicated set of equations. Finding astrophysically relevant solutions to these equations requires the most sophisticated numerical algorithms and powerful supercomputers available. The search for astrophysical solutions has made numerical relativity one of the most active areas of research in gravitational physics. Of particular interest in numerical relativity has been simulating the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries involving black holes and neutrons stars. The outcome from these simulations will bring general relativity into harmony with the observations of gravitational radiation that are expected to take place in the immediate future. This article highlights current progress in numerical relativity. It also attempts to envision the future of this field and its integration with gravitational wave astronomy.,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0006,[]

The evolution of the latter two concepts, and of relation between them, in physical theories from Newtonian mechanics to general relativity is outlined, culminating in the development of the concept of space-time and its dynamization. The chrono-geometrical and inertio-gravitational space-time structures are defined, and the compatibility relations between the two are discussed. The philosophical debate between absolute and relational concepts of space and then of space-time is reviewed, as is the contrast between pre-general-relativistic theories with fixed background space-time structures and background-free general relativistic theories. Some implications of this contrast for the problem of quantum gravity are indicated.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812700988_0001,[]

The interactions and structure of exotic nuclei close to the drip lines have been studied extensively worldwide, and it has been revealed that unstable nuclei, having weakly bound nucleons, exhibit characteristic features such as a halo structure and a soft dipole excitation. We here review the developments of the physics of unstable nuclei in the past few decades.

High Energy Nuclear Physics: From Bear Mountain to the LHC,"I review the development of high energy nuclear physics, in particular the attempts to make new forms of matter in hadronic collisions. I begin with early experimental work done at the Bevelac, the AGS and the SPS. Early theoretical work concentrated on understanding properties of quark and gluonic matter at high temperature and density, the Quark Gluon Plama (QGP), particularly using the methods of lattice gauge theory. Recent theoretical work has involved attempts to more quantitatively describe data coming from experiments at RHIC and LHC. In addition, new forms of matter have been proposed to describe the early times in hadronic collisions. The Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is the high density gluonic matter that initially composes colliding high energy nuclei. The Glasma is highly coherent color electric and color magnetic fields radiating gluons that eventually thermalize. Methods derivative of strongly interacting gauge theory (AdSCFT Correspondence) have been employed to qualitatively understand finite temperature QCD when the intrinsic strength of interactions is strong. The RHIC and LHC experiments provide compelling experimental data to establish that the matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy is a strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP). To what degree, in my opinion, the sQGP is a thermally equilibrated Quark Gluon Plasma, or a Glasma is not yet determined…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0007,[]

Symmetries and Dynamical Symmetries in Nuclei,"Nuclei are very complex systems. Even without going to the level of quarks and gluons, they are systems of strongly interacting protons and neutrons (nucleons). Their number is usually higher than in a few-body system. It is also sufficiently small and cannot be treated statistically. In spite of their complexity, nuclei exhibit some simple regularities, which may be expressed by simple models. The most important regularity is the apparent independent motion of nucleons. The success of the shell model in describing many aspects of nuclear physics is based on this regularity. The shell structure leads to many symmetries which are briefly considered in this review. Only those that are associated with the spherical shell model will be presented. Nuclei that exhibit collective phenomena, like rotational spectra, are well described by a deformed potential well. They will not be discussed here. The limited space does not allow derivation of many results and they will simply be quoted. This allows a rather concise overview of some important symmetries and dynamical symmetries of nuclear states…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814425810_0004,[]

The intrinsic weakness of gravity-wave signals requires a proactive approach to modeling the prospective sources and anticipating the shape of the signals that we seek to detect. Full-blown 3-D numerical simulations of the sources are playing and will play an important role in planning the gravity-wave data-analysis effort.

WHAT GRAVITATIONAL SIGNALS SAY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND THE EVOLUTION OF ASTROPHYSICAL SOURCES,"Gravitational waves transport very detailed information on the structure and evolution of astrophysical sources. For instance a binary system in the early stages of its evolution emits a wavetrain at specific frequencies that depend on the characteristics of the obital motion; as the orbit shrinks and circularize, due to radiation reaction effects, the orbiting bodies get closer and tidally interact. This interaction may result in the excitation of the proper modes of oscillation of the stars, and in the emission of gravitational signals that carry information on the mode frequencies, and consequently on the equation of state in the stellar interior. These phenomena may occur either in solar type stars with orbiting planets and in compact binaries, and in this lecture we will discuss different approaches that can be used to study these processes in the framework of General Relativity.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812791368_0015,[]

Appendix 1: Political Development and Social Experiment in Contemporary China,"It is widely recognized that China has seen remarkable results in its economic development over the past 30 years since its reform and opening-up. However, some think that China's development over the past 30 years has mainly been in the economic sector while little advancement has been made in the extremely important area of politics. I personally believe that this view does not truly reflect the facts of China's political development over the past 30-plus years. It cannot be denied that many problems still exist at China's current stage of development, but generally, there has been extensive advancement in China's political sector. This advancement is both qualitative and quantitative. It is hard to imagine that a country without any accomplishments in its political sector would be able to sustain high-paced economic growth for more than 30 years. This is why if I were to describe China's development in one sentence, I would have to say that “China's success in the economic and social sectors are ensured by developments in the political sector.” Here, I will discuss four topics…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814730648_0015,[]

TOPOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES IN THE THEORY OF ANDERSON LOCALIZATION,"Scaling ideas in the theory of the quantum Hall effect are fundamentally based on topological principles in Anderson localization theory. These concepts have a very general significance and are not limited to replica field theory or disordered systems alone. In this chapter, we will discuss these ideas in several distinctly different physical contexts. We start with a brief overview that spans two and a half decades of experimental research on quantum criticality in strong magnetic fields. Secondly, we address the new understanding of universality that has emerged from the theory of Anderson localization and interaction phenomena. In the last part we show how the experimentally observed quantum phenomena fundamentally alter the way in which strong coupling problems in theoretical physics are perceived.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814299084_0021,[]
"ANDERSON LOCALIZATION VS. MOTT–HUBBARD METAL–INSULATOR TRANSITION IN DISORDERED, INTERACTING LATTICE FERMION SYSTEMS","We review recent progress in our theoretical understanding of strongly correlated fermion systems in the presence of disorder. Results were obtained by the application of a powerful nonperturbative approach, the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), to interacting disordered lattice fermions. In particular, we demonstrate that DMFT combined with geometric averaging over disorder can capture Anderson localization and Mott insulating phases on the level of one-particle correlation functions. Results are presented for the ground state phase diagram of the Anderson–Hubbard model at half-filling, both in the paramagnetic phase and in the presence of antiferromagnetic order.

FINITE SIZE SCALING ANALYSIS OF THE ANDERSON TRANSITION,"This chapter describes the progress made during the past three decades in the finite size scaling analysis of the critical phenomena of the Anderson transition. The scaling theory of localization and the Anderson model of localization are briefly sketched. The finite size scaling method is described. Recent results for the critical exponents of the different symmetry classes are summarised. The importance of corrections to scaling are emphasised. A comparison with experiment is made, and a direction for future work is suggested.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814299084_0016,[]
MATHEMATICAL ASPECTS OF ANDERSON LOCALIZATION,"This article discusses mathematical results and conjectures motivated by Anderson localization and by related problems for deterministic and nonlinear systems.

QUANTUM NETWORK MODELS AND CLASSICAL LOCALIZATION PROBLEMS,"A review is given of quantum network models in class C which, on a suitable 2d lattice, describe the spin quantum Hall plateau transition. On a general class of graphs, however, many observables of such models can be mapped to those of a classical walk in a random environment, thus relating questions of quantum and classical localization. In many cases it is possible to make rigorous statements about the latter through the relation to associated percolation problems, in both two and three dimensions.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814299084_0014,[]
WEAK LOCALIZATION AND ELECTRON–ELECTRON INTERACTION EFFECTS IN THIN METAL WIRES AND FILMS,A brief and selective review of experimental studies of electrical conduction in thin metal wires and films at low temperatures is given.

WEAK LOCALIZATION AND ITS APPLICATIONS AS AN EXPERIMENTAL TOOL,"The resistance of two-dimensional electron systems such as thin disordered films shows deviations from Boltzmann theory, which are caused by quantum corrections and are called weak localization. The theoretical origin of weak localization is the Langer–Neal graph in Kubo formalism. It represents an interference experiment with conduction electrons split into pairs of waves interfering in the back-scattering direction. The intensity of the interference (integrated over the time) can easily be measured by the resistance of the film. The application of a magnetic field B destroys the phase coherence after a time which is proportional to 1/B. For a field of 1 T this time is of the order of 1 ps. Therefore with a dc experiment, one can measure characteristic times of the electron system in the range of picoseconds. Weak localization has been applied to measure dephasing, spin-orbit scattering, tunneling times, etc. One important field of application is the investigation of magnetic systems and magnetic impurities by measuring the magnetic dephasing time and its temperature dependence. Here the Kondo maximum of spin-flip scattering, spin-fluctuations, Fermi liquid behavior and magnetic d-resonances have been investigated. Another field is the detection of magnetic moments for very dilute alloys and surface impurities.

THE LOCALIZATION TRANSITION AT FINITE TEMPERATURES: ELECTRIC AND THERMAL TRANSPORT,"The Anderson localization transition is considered at finite temperatures.

FROM ANDERSON LOCALIZATION TO MESOSCOPIC PHYSICS,"In the late seventies an increasing interest in the scaling theory of Anderson localization led to new efforts to understand the conductance of systems which scatter electrons elastically. The conductance and its relation to the scattering matrix emerged as an important subject. This, coupled with the desire to find explicit manifestations of single electron interference, led to the emergence of mesoscopic physics. We review electron transport phenomena which can be expressed elegantly in terms of the scattering matrix. Of particular interest are phenomena which depend not only on transmission probabilities but on both amplitude and phase of scattering matrix elements.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814299084_0008,[]
SCALING OF VON NEUMANN ENTROPY AT THE ANDERSON TRANSITION,"Extensive body of work has shown that for the model of a non-interacting electron in a random potential there is a quantum critical point for dimensions greater than two — a metal–insulator transition. This model also plays an important role in the plateau-to-plateu transition in the integer quantum Hall effect, which is also correctly captured by a scaling theory. Yet, in neither of these cases the ground state energy shows any non-analyticity as a function of a suitable tuning parameter, typically considered to be a hallmark of a quantum phase transition, similar to the non-analyticity of the free energy in a classical phase transition. Here we show that von Neumann entropy (entanglement entropy) is non-analytic at these phase transitions and can track the fundamental changes in the internal correlations of the ground state wave function. In particular, it summarizes the spatially wildly fluctuating intensities of the wave function close to the criticality of the Anderson transition. It is likely that all quantum phase transitions can be similarly described.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814299084_0007,[]

SELF-CONSISTENT THEORY OF ANDERSON LOCALIZATION: GENERAL FORMALISM AND APPLICATIONS,"The self-consistent theory of Anderson localization of quantum particles or classical waves in disordered media is reviewed. After presenting the basic concepts of the theory of Anderson localization in the case of electrons in disordered solids, the regimes of weak and strong localization are discussed. Then the scaling theory of the Anderson localization transition is reviewed. The renormalization group theory is introduced and results and consequences are presented. It is shown how scale-dependent terms in the renormalized perturbation theory of the inverse diffusion coefficient lead in a natural way to a self-consistent equation for the diffusion coefficient. The latter accounts quantitatively for the static and dynamic transport properties except for a region near the critical point. Several recent applications and extensions of the self-consistent theory, in particular for classical waves, are discussed.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814299084_0004,[]

ANDERSON LOCALIZATION IN THE SEVENTIES AND BEYOND,"Little attention was paid to Anderson's challenging paper on localization for the first ten years, but from 1968 onwards it generated a lot of interest. Around that time a number of important questions were raised by the community, on matters such as the existence of a sharp distinction between localized and extended states, or between conductors and insulators. For some of these questions the answers are unambiguous. There certainly are energy ranges in which states are exponentially localized, in the presence of a static disordered potential. In a weakly disordered one-dimensional potential, all states are localized. There is clear evidence, in three dimensions, for energy ranges in which states are extended, and ranges in which they are diffusive. Magnetic and spin-dependent interactions play an important part in reducing localization effects. For massive particles like electrons and atoms the lowest energy states are localized, but for massless particles like photons and acoustic phonons the lowest energy states are extended.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814299084_0002,[]

The New Cosmology greatly extends the highly successful hot big-bang model. Now we have to make sense of all this: What is the dark matter particle? What is the nature of the dark energy?

This strategy is based on energy production and energy consumption data, which are presented and analyzed for Slovenia and Croatia. The first component is maximising the use of renewable energy sources. The second strategy component comprises scenarios for changing consumption patterns to meet the sustainability requirements. The third one is emphasising fundamental curiosity driven research that throughout the history has proven to be the most effective solution for various problems including those of energy production. These strategies are being analyzed for Slovenia and Croatia. Besides the technology fix we discuss also social implications of a change in consumption patterns. These three components of the strategy aim not only to meet the requirements of the Kyoto protocol and EU standards, but to make significant progress toward achieving genuine sustainable development according to the original Brundtland Commission definition.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0031,[]
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL URBAN BUSES OPERATING IN THE CITY OF PORTO,"The aim of the CUTE project was to develop and demonstrate an emission-free and low-noise transport system, including the accompanying energy infrastructure, which has great potential for reducing the global greenhouse effect towards the Kyoto protocol, improving the quality of the atmosphere and life in densely populated areas and conserving fossil resources. For the CUTE project a total of 27 buses were built by EvoBus. These vehicles are based on the Mercedes-Benz Citaro model city bus and run on hydrogen using fuel cells for power generation. One of the participating cities was Porto, where the local bus company (STCP – Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto) is operating three buses. The hydrogen infrastructure is supplied by BP. The hydrogen is produced centrally by electrolysis from grid electricity. In the project, IST is conducting the study of the environmental impact (based on a well to wheel approach) of the operation of the buses and the comparison with conventional technologies (Diesel, compressed natural gas and electricity).

"GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSION REDUCTION IN AN URBAN BUS FLEET: APPLICATION TO A CASE STUDY IN FUNCHAL, MADEIRA ISLAND","The Transport Sector is now one of the main consumers of energetic resources. In Portugal, an Energy Audit and Energy Consumption Rationalization Plan was published in the form of law number 58/82, set out in the RGCE-regulations. The primary objective of the RGCE-regulations is to influence companies to consider energy as a cost factor. Auditing a bus operator company implies understanding where energy is consumed and how can it be more efficiently used. In this kind of company the vehicles are the main consumers of primary energy. Trying to improve the energy efficiency and consequently reduce the greenhouse gases emissions of all the fleet implies to analyze those vehicles in normal operational conditions. This is not an easy task, because it means to study all the vehicles operating in all the network lines, for different traffic conditions and different occupancy rates. TRANSTEP is the new developed methodology that intends to simplify this task.

EARTH TUBE VENTILATION SYSTEM: A PROJECT PRE-FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS TOOL,"Increasing energy demand and rapid depletion of non-renewable resources have forced mankind to search for alternative energy resources.

Earth heat exchangers are advantageous features to reduce energy consumption in residential buildings. In winter they pre-heat ventilation air with minimal operation costs - necessary for low energy architecture -, in summer they help to prevent passive houses with relevant solar gains from overheating by pre-cooling ventilation air.

SOLAR POWER AGRICULTURE: A NEW PARADIGM FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION,"The present paper argues that solar power technologies, such as photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, should be regarded as a form of agriculture in the paradigm named here “solar power agriculture”. These technologies share several features with traditional agriculture, for instance the basic process of energy conversion by collecting solar light over relatively large areas. Solar power technologies and agriculture also share a dynamic resource growth curve which is s-shaped in contrast with that of non-renewable fossil resources which is bell shaped. Conventional agriculture uses solar light to produce food, textiles and other products, whereas solar power technologies mainly use light to generate electric power. Framing renewable energy within a well known and accepted paradigm, that of agriculture, leads to major advantages in terms of public image, with the consequent unlocking of the financial resources needed to increase the use of renewable resources. The concept of solar power agriculture provides a bridge between the present situation in which renewable play a marginal role in the world's energy production to a future situation when renewables will instead play a major role.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0021,[]
NON-TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO LARGE-SCALE WAVE ENERGY UTILISATION,"In order to enable a large-scale implementation without violating the principles of sustainability, it is of high importance to avoid conflicts that partly emerged from the context of the large-scale implementation of other RE technologies, mainly with respect to environmental and societal sensitivities. In addition to the lessons learnt from other technologies, there is a number of specific aspects for the utilisation of wave energy that have to be taken into account with sufficient care in the early phases of development. In the present paper the approach of the WEC (Wave Energy Centre) to seize these aspects, is presented, based on results of a case study on these non-technical barriers to large-scale development of wave energy basically arising from environmental sensitivity aspects and competing uses of the ocean. The utilisation of wave energy is generally deemed environmentally benign and only results of several years of operation at significant scale may confirm the validity of this evaluation. Therefore, emphasis in this phase is given to the aspects of conflict of use, which can easily be underestimated in the implementation of this renewable energy. Although the study has been elaborated for the situation in Portugal, several findings are expected to have generic character.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0020,[]

PROCESS DYNAMICS OF FOSSIL STEAM POWER PLANTS INDUCED BY THE INTEGRATION OF TRANSIENT SOLAR HEAT,"In the current paper a concept to integrate solar steam generated by parabolic trough collectors into a fossil fueled power plant is being investigated. Feed water preheaters are one favourable location to integrate the external heat into the water steam cycle. Since the addition of the external energy causes less steam consumption in the high pressure and low pressure preheaters, less steam is extracted from the steam turbine. This leads to an increasing output of electrical power, which is a profitable product at the energy stock markets. The occurring time dependent processes are studied on a numerical basis, using the dynamic process simulation software APROS from VTT. With APROS a model of the parabolic trough collectors (62 MW maximum thermal output) was built-up, adapted and parameterized with typical lay-out data. Using meteorological data from southern Europe the time dependent steam generation was simulated. The collector model has been connected with a comprehensive APROS-model of an existing fossil steam power plant with a nominal output of 393 MW. The results show, as expected, that the steam generated by the solar collectors varies directly with the irradiation present. In July the power plant output increases at noon by 17.5 MW from 393 MW to 410.5 MW with a maximum gradient of 0.3 MW/min.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0017,[]

A COMPARISON OF POWER GENERATION FROM BIOMASS IN A SMALL CFBC PLANT WITH BIOMASS CO-FIRED WITH COAL IN A LARGE CFBC,"Biomass is one of the renewable energy sources which is not intermittent, location-dependent or very difficult to store. If grown sustainably, biomass can be considered to be CO2 neutral. The use of biomass for power generation is also considered to be important in increasing the electricity output from renewable energy sources. However, power plants dedicated to the use of biomass fuel are not in widespread use and the acceptance of this fuel and development of the infrastructure for biomass production and transportation remain in their infancy. If small ratios of biomass can be co-fired with coal in large-scale conventional power plants, without significant technical, environmental or economic penalties, it could lead to a greater demand for biomass and stimulate the industry. In this study a 80 MWth CFBC, fuelled by biomass only, and a large-scale 1000 MWth CFBC, co-fired with coal and 8% biomass, and the same large CFBC system, fired only with coal, are modelled using the ECLIPSE process simulation package and their technical, environmental and economic properties analysed and compared. The co-firing of biomass with coal was found to have little effect on the large-scale CFBC system, when a small ratio of biomass is used. The large scale system was found to have higher efficiency, lower CO2 emissions and lower break-even electricity selling price than the small biomass-fuelled CFBC. Co-firing of biomass with coal could be a promising way of promoting the production, use and acceptance of biomass as a fuel in electricity generation.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0015,[]
PRODUCTION OF BIOCOAL FROM CASSAVA STALK,"Thailand is an agricultural country. Each year the country produced not only agricultural product but also more than 50 million tons of agricultural residues. Cassava stalk is the fourth largest agricultural residues which accounted more than 4 million tons per year. Cassava stalk consider as useless agricultural residues. Production of biocoal from cassava stalk is the process to convert the useless residues into useful fuel. Production of biocoal from cassava stalk consisted of two main processes: production of charcoal from cassava stalk and briquetting of cassava stalk charcoal. The charcoal yield was 22.18% and the suitable binder to charcoal ratio was 1 to 7. Biocoal from cassava stalk has more ash than Eucalyptus charcoal but fixed carbon and calorific value are lower than Eucalyptus charcoal. However, the calorific value of this biocoal is still higher than calorific value of firewood. So, biocoal from cassava stalk can be used as household cooking fuel instead of firewood and charcoal.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0014,[]
USE OF BIOMASS IN SMALL DIRECT FIRED SYSTEMS,"This paper discusses the context for the use of biomass for electricity generation in the UK and similar markets and evaluates the possibility of using cyclonic gasification coupled to small gas turbine systems. In the UK the Government has strongly pushed for a significant increase in the use of renewable energy for electricity generation with only very modest success, nearly 3% coming from this source at present, predominantly hydro and wind. Subsidy for the early systems came from an elevated price for generated electricity, but since then attempts at price convergence with that pertaining with conventional fossil fuel generation systems has not occurred and the number of small biomass systems being constructed and their net generating capacity has not increased in line with other technologies. This is in contrast to co-firing of biomass with coal in large utility boilers which has increased substantially over the last few years. Although small scale utilisation technologies exist, (< 50 MWe) and are well proven technologically in Scandinavia, when translated to markets such as the UK, give generating costs which are not competitive with other forms of renewable energy. Problems have arisen with many systems, being predominantly due to fouling/slagging, the different nature of the fuels, and elevated moisture content. In this context this paper describes an EU sponsored programme of work to develop a simple cyclone gasifier and combustor which can produce a medium calorific fuel gas for materials such as sawdust, retain up to about 80% of the total ash/residues in the system, and fire simple, low cost gas turbines for power generation. The system is shown to have a very wide operating range and can handle sawdust with significant quantities of material up to 4 mm in size, whilst tolerating significant variation in moisture content and capturing very significant quantities of the ash/particulate matter as well as volatile species. The economics of the system are discussed and related to other technologies that are available and markets identified where potential exists.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0012,[]
KINETIC STUDY OF FROTH FLOTATION FOR PET-PVC SEPARATION,"Froth flotation is a separation process widely used in mineral processing and it has been tested in the separation of plastics from post-consumer waste, namely PET and PVC. The complexity of this process and the scarce comprehension of the physical and chemical mechanisms involved in the plastics flotation make it an interesting subject of research. It is widely accepted that, although time consuming, a kinetic study is the most correct way to evaluate the flotation process. In the work presented here, a four-factor / two levels experimental design was carried out to study the effect of the variables depressor concentration, frother concentration, pH and proportion of plastic in the mixture, on the flotation rate parameters, amounting to 2",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0011,[]
APPLICATION OF BIOFUELS TO COMPRESSION IGNITION ENGINES,"A review on application of alcohols and biofuels, especially crude vegetable oils and their esters has been carried out. Dual fuel engine, fuelled with diesel fuel (DF) and alternatively with rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) as a main fuel and bioethanol injected during inlet stroke into the inlet port as supporting burning of RME was developed and investigated. The concept of ethanol injection consists in this, that after ignition by burning DF/RME droplets, ethanol-air mixture burns very quickly and promotes combustion of main fuel droplets, resulting in shorter combustion period. Experiment was carried out with the use of one-cylinder direct injection diesel engine adapted for ethanol injection. Investigations were performed at two constant loads, for which the ratio of ethanol and base fuel were changed: high and low, at each load engine was run at three speeds for three injection timings. Results of investigation showed considerable decrease of CO",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0010,[]
IMPLEMENTATION OF ANAEROBIC DIGESTION PLANTS IN BREWERIES – DIFFICULTIES AND BENEFITS,"The anaerobic microbial conversion of organic matter into biogas is state of the art. Organically high loaded wastewater is treated preferably by anaerobic digestion (AD), e.g. wastes and wastewater of the food industry. Breweries generate not only above-average amounts of wastewater and organic wastes but also a very inhomogeneous wastewater. Treating a brewery's wastewater presumes knowledge of its origin and composition to optimise the digestion process. Principles of anaerobic biological wastewater treatment are illustrated as well as typical factors for operating a biogas plant in breweries. These factors can be influenced only in a certain range. In general the implementation of AD plants in breweries shall be accompanied by restructuring the energy and wastewater management. Especially the utilisation of biogas respectively surplus heat asks for an intensive consideration of the production process. In Germany changing legislative restrictions and acts on granting priority to renewable energy sources offer thought-provoking impulses.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0009,[]
PRODUCTION OF SUSTAINABLE HYDROGEN USING THERMOCHEMICAL GASIFICATION OF BIOMASS,"Hydrogen production systems based on thermochemical gasification of biomass typically consist of the following basic steps: pre-treatment, gasification, gas cleaning, upgrading and separation. The development of the technology depends on the successful integration of these steps and technical and economic analysis is required to match the optimum technology with available feedstock to produce a product of the necessary quality for the target application. The section Energy Technology is participating in a new EU-funded project which is aimed at developing and optimizing an energy-efficient and cost-efficient method to produce hydrogen-rich gases from biomass, including residues, using circulating fluidised bed technology. This gas can then be upgraded to commercial quality hydrogen or to synthesis gas for further upgrading to liquid fuels such as DME and methanol or Fischer-Tropsch diesel. An existing 100 kWth circulating fluidised bed gasifier will be modified and used to assess the influence of operating parameters such as oxidant type (oxygen concentration, steam) on the gasification process experimentally. The influence operating conditions relevant for hydrogen production on the formation of the main components and contaminants will be determined under. An experimental and theoretical analysis will be made of the fate of alkali metals and particulates throughout the system including the high temperature gas filter. An analysis of the bottlenecks caused by these components will be given and a detailed description of the Delft tasks and their role in the multidisciplinary R&D project will be presented.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0007,[]
MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE VALORISATION AS ENERGY FOR ISOLATED COMMUNITIES,"The amount of generated municipal solid waste (MSW), which is a result of human activities, is continuously increasing and following trends of economy and population changes. Sustainable waste management requires a good integrated waste management system and government policies that encourage waste prevention, reuse and both materials and thermal recycling. Eventually, landfills will only be used for stabilised materials. Suitable legislation is necessary with incentives and raise public awareness, to maximise the valorisation of waste materials. Municipal solid waste incineration represents a considerable potential for reduction in reactivity of any residual landfilled material on one side and potential energy source on another. Therefore, incineration as a way of municipal solid waste valorisation has a high importance in resources recovery within the integrated waste management. Power generation from waste could be a significant contribution to the reduction in overall emissions and an alternative to displace energy produced from fossil fuels. Therefore, a demand for increasing amounts of MSW to incinerate is expectable. Heat recovery, efficient flue gas cleaning systems and significant greenhouse gas abatement capacity makes municipal solid waste incineration an attractive environmentally sound option. In the present paper the authors focus on the potential of MSW incineration and its implementation to energy systems for isolated communities such as islands. Islands have several particular characteristics that considerably influence their energy and sustainable waste management options, which will be addressed. Based on a selected case, it will be demonstrated what are the possible ways of implementation and perspectives for municipal solid waste treatment and exploitation.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0006,[]
INTELLIGENT OPERATION MANAGEMENT OF FUEL CELLS AND MICRO-TURBINES USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND NEURAL NETWORKS,"This paper demonstrates a new-two-stage intelligent technique to manage the operation of Distributed Generating “DG” units for residential utilization. In the first stage of the optimization process, a Genetic Algorithm “GA” is used to define the optimal settings of DG units depending on detailed economic models. For online applications and to avoid the repetitive time-consuming optimization process, the procedure is generalized in the second stage using an Artificial Neural Network “ANN”. The objective is to develop an intelligent management tool, which can be used in the online mode and depends only on the parameters obtained from the structure of the ANN. Variations of load demands and operating tariffs can easily be simulated online as they represent the main inputs of the ANN. The first stage of the management process is applied alternatively to a single fuel cell unit, three fuel cell units operating in parallel and a micro-turbine unit. However, the ANN generalization process is applied only with the single fuel cell unit as it shows the most economic operation regarding the operating costs. The results obtained in this research encourage the use of this technique in order to achieve a simple, fast and effective online management of DG units for residential applications.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0005,[]

In order to identify the potential for such MH/TEG-units, a TEG-model has been developed that is currently being verified based on laboratory experiments. Over the past several years hydrogen energy system experts at IFE have developed and managed a collection of hydrogen energy models (HYDROGEMS) that is increasingly being used to develop renewable-hydrogen (RE/H",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0004,[]

PROMOTING RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY THROUGH THE CDM FUNDING OPTIONS,"The promotion of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Energy Efficiency (EE) is a central aim of the world energy policy in order to contribute in reducing greenhouse emissions. Moreover, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows Annex I countries to achieve their emission targets. Financial assistance to developing countries is needed in order to avoid high increase of their greenhouse emissions associated with their development. Today, a large number of Annex I countries are also setting up programmes to fund RES and EE investment through CDM. These include Denmark, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Norway, Canada and Austria. These programmes are being applied by international organisations and numerous non-governmental organisations and they facilitate projects throughout the developing world. Initial experiences have also been gained from the “World Bank Prototype Carbon Fund - PCF” and the “Dutch CDM tender-programme - CERUPT”. The most important result of these initial experiences is the creation of appropriate organisational structures and the use of qualified personnel by both the host and investor countries and the respective participants in the project, thus, building the capacity to facilitate the CDM. This paper describes the main role of CDM funding programmes and their potential role in promoting RES and EE projects.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812707437_0001,[]

Through a simulation study for Singapore and Hong Kong, we show that exchange rate fluctuations have a great impact on the cost of living rankings for both expatriates and ordinary residents. We next highlight an interesting observation emerging from our study, that cities in the developed Western countries are more expensive for ordinary residents than cities in less developed countries elsewhere, especially in Asia. We attribute this to structural difference in labour cost between these two sets of countries.

We all know that Harrod–Domar and Solow's economic growth models fail to explain the difference of economic growth in different regions. That's why the theory of endogenous growth comes to take the place in the 90s. So, we adopt the endogenous growth theory to analyse the economic growth of Jiangsu and Taiwan. And we also use Geweke causality analysis approach, which turns out to be more informative and contributive than the Granger causality analysis approach, in our efforts to put forward macro-economic development strategies of these two regions.

Role of the ASEAN Committee of Permanent Representatives,"Denigrated by many as “No Action, Talk Only” (NATO), ASEAN continues to bedevil and confuse its critics by its frustratingly slow but yet ever forward movement in its development as a regional organisation. In the earlier years, I would have classified myself as an adherent to the NATO school of thought, with the survival of the organisation itself being seen as a sign of success. Lest my views are misunderstood, ASEAN has been, and even to this day, continues to be a very useful organisation for the region. It managed to bring together a diverse set of countries, fostering a habit of consultation and close personal interactions at all levels, which in turn fostered peace and stability in the region. My reservations rested on the way the organisation had organised itself and its path towards progress. It was an organisation built on informality, with a lack of credible institutions. It was messy in its approach. In some ways, those were the very elements of its success, but how will it develop as it matures, as all organisations must, if it is to keep moving forward, much less survive, in the longer term? It is true that ASEAN has had successes. It spawned off the likes of ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM Plus), ASEAN+3 and the East Asia Summit (EAS) over the years, and in a sense, that has kept the organisation relevant, regardless of what one thinks of these entities. In a sense, ASEAN has built additional wings to its building. However, the foundation is still suspect. These “successes”, if one can refer to them as such, do not really speak to the core of ASEAN, of how, going forward, it will develop in order to at least maintain some relevance in the strategic evolution of our region, apart from providing the settings for others to do so. The alternative is to continue to do things as we have always done and hope for the best…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813225138_0034,[]

The 1998/1999 Nipah virus outbreak among pigs affected pig handlers in Malaysia, resulting in 257 human cases and 105 deaths, and the culling of more than one million pigs. The 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which originated in southern China, spread rapidly to Vietnam resulting in 63 human cases and 5 deaths, and to Singapore resulting in 238 cases and 33 deaths. The H5N1 avian influenza virus, first introduced to poultry in Southeast Asia in 2004, had spread widely despite efforts to control the virus through the culling of infected poultry flocks. It resulted in more than 350 human cases and 250 deaths. ASEAN countries were also substantially affected by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which spread rapidly from the Americas through global trade and travel routes. Other re-emerging threats such as the mosquito-borne dengue and Zika viruses are also seeing a resurgence…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813225138_0006,[]

The Role of ASEAN in the Resolution of the Indochinese Refugee Outflow in the 1970s and 1980s,"During the 1970s and 1980s, conflicts in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia brought about great political and social upheavals. Particularly after 1975, with the communist take-overs and withdrawal of the United States from these countries, one of the most serious consequences was the outflow of hundreds of thousands of refugees. The refugee outflows were to last for almost two decades and impacted heavily on the neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore, the then five members of ASEAN…",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813225138_0004,[]
"ASEAN and the Cambodian Conflict, 1978–1991","Vietnam invaded Kampuchea on 25 December 1978. On 8 January 1979, the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh announced the formation of the Khmer People’s Revolutionary Party (KPRP) that included Heng Samrin as the President, Hun Sen as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chea Sim as Minister of the Interior. It was clearly against international law. The Vietnamese, however, calculated that, as Ha Van Lau the Vietnamese Permanent Representative to the United Nations, told his Singapore counterpart at the United Nations, Tommy Koh, “in two weeks, the world will have forgotten the Kampuchean problem”. Hanoi had envisaged an invasion that resembled the Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia — “a quick blitzkrieg operation, destruction of all resistance, rapid establishment of a ",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789813225138_0003,[]
