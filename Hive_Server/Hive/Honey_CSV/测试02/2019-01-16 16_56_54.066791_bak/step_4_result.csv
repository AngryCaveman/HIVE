            Perspective: Preservation of coherence in photophysical processes
                ","Coherence is one of the most important phenomena in ultrafast sciences. We give our perspective on the terminology, observation, and preservation of coherence in photophysical processes with some glimpses to the past and some looking-head to what may pave the way for scaling one of the last bastions in ultrafast science, namely, that of mode specific chemistry where it will be possible to break any specific bond by tailoring the pulse, an accomplishment that obviously would be the dream of any chemist.",https://aca.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5079265,[]

            Tensile strength/yield strength (TS/YS) ratios of high-strength steel (HSS) reinforcing bars
                ","The building codes such as American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318M-14 and Standard National Indonesia (SNI) 2847:2013 require that the ratio of tensile strength (TS) and yield strength (YS) should not less than 1.25. The requirement is based on the assumption that a capability of a structural member to develop inelastic rotation capacity is a function of the length of the yield region. This paper reports an investigation on various steel grades, namely Grades 420, 550, 650, and 700 MPa, to examine the impact of different TS/YS ratios if it is less or greater than the required value. Grades 550, 650, and 700 MPa were purposely selected with the intention to examine if these higher grades are still promising to be implemented in special structural systems since they are prohibited by the building codes for longitudinal reinforcement, whereas Grade 420 MPa bars are the maximum limit of yield strength of reinforcing bars that is allowable for longitudinal reinforcement of special structural systems. Tensile tests of these steel samples were conducted under displacement controlled mode to capture the complete stress-strain curves and particularly the post-yield response of the steel bars. From the study, it can be concluded that Grade 420 performed higher TS/YS ratios and they were able to reach up to more than 1.25. However, the High Strength Still (HSS) bars (Grades 550, 600, and 700 MPa) resulted in lower TS/YS ratios (less than 1.25) compared with those of Grade 420 MPa.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5038318,[]

            Surface tractions on an ellipsoid in Stokes flow: Quadratic ambient fields
                ","The surface tractions on an ellipsoid undergoing rigid body motion in an ambient Stokes flow field are known to be surprisingly simple—essentially of the same form as the boundary condition for the disturbance velocity multiplied by the dot product of the position vector at the ellipsoid surface and the outward surface normal at that point. The direct derivation of these remarkable classical results via the Newtonian constitutive equation is straightforward but requires many pages of algebra. More recently, a more satisfying explanation of this result was derived by proving that the Stokes flow double layer operator acting on the surface of an ellipsoid is self-adjoint for a particular weighted metric space (discussed in this work). In the present paper, this result, which the authors call the weighted ellipsoidal metric space theorem, is exploited to derive simple forms for the surface tractions on a force-free ellipsoid in a quadratic ambient field. After even more pages of algebra than encountered for the classical flows, the tractions reduce to a simple form: the weighting function times a quadratic in the position vector (without the guidance of the general theory, the initial expressions for the traction would have taken several columns or pages of this journal). The nature of the derivation along with the corresponding analysis of the eigensystem of the double layer operator suggests that for the general polynomial ambient field, the surface traction is a polynomial in the position vector of the same degree, multiplied by the weighting function.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5054698,[]

            Integral Cross Sections for Electron–Magnesium Scattering Over a Broad Energy Range (0–5000 eV)
                ","We report the results from the application of our optical potential and relativistic optical potential (ROP) methods to electron–magnesium scattering. The energy range of this study was 0–5000 eV, with the results for the integral elastic cross sections, summed discrete electronic-state excitation integral cross sections, momentum transfer cross sections, and total ionisation cross sections being reported. Where possible, we compare the present results to the available experimental data and to the earlier results from close coupling and R-matrix type computations. Typically, a quite fair level of accord is found between our ROP calculations and the earlier theoretical and experimental cross sections. Additionally, from the assembled database, we provide for the modeling community some recommended cross section sets for use in their simulations, in which magnesium is a constituent. Electron transport coefficients are subsequently calculated for reduced electric fields ranging from 0.1 to 1000 Td using a multi-term solution of Boltzmann’s equation. Substantial differences in the transport coefficients between the ROP calculations and the recommended cross sections are observed over the range of fields considered, clearly illustrating the importance of the veracity of the database in the simulations.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5081132,[]

            The impact of interior dielectric constant and entropic change on HIV-1 complex binding free energy prediction
                ","At present, the calculated binding free energy obtained using the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann (Generalized-Born) surface area (MM/PB(GB)SA) method is overestimated due to the lack of knowledge of suitable interior dielectric constants in the simulation on the interaction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) protease systems with inhibitors. Therefore, the impact of different values of the interior dielectric constant and the entropic contribution when using the MM/PB(GB)SA method to calculate the binding free energy was systemically evaluated. Our results show that the use of higher interior dielectric constants (1.4–2.0) can clearly improve the predictive accuracy of the MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods, and computational errors are significantly reduced by including the effects of electronic polarization and using a new highly efficient interaction entropy (IE) method to calculate the entropic contribution. The suitable range for the interior dielectric constant is 1.4–1.6 for the MM/PBSA method; within this range, the correlation coefficient fluctuates around 0.84, and the mean absolute error fluctuates around 2 kcal/mol. Similarly, an interior dielectric constant of 1.8–2.0 produces a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.76 when using the MM/GBSA method. In addition, the entropic contribution of each individual residue was further calculated using the IE method to predict hot-spot residues, and the detailed binding mechanisms underlying the interactions of the HIV-1 protease, its inhibitors, and bridging water molecules were investigated. In this study, the use of a higher interior dielectric constant and the IE method can improve the calculation accuracy of the HIV-1 system.",https://aca.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5058172,[]

            Intermittent plasticity in individual grains: A study using high energy x-ray diffraction
                ","Long-standing evidence suggests that plasticity in metals may proceed in an intermittent fashion. While the documentation of intermittency in plastically deforming materials has been achieved in several experimental settings, efforts to draw connections from dislocation motion and structure development to stress relaxation have been limited, especially in the bulk of deforming polycrystals. This work uses high energy x-ray diffraction measurements to build these links by characterizing plastic deformation events inside individual deforming grains in both the titanium alloy, Ti-7Al, and the magnesium alloy, AZ31. This analysis is performed by combining macroscopic stress relaxation data, complete grain stress states found using far-field high energy diffraction microscopy, and rapid x-ray diffraction spot measurements made using a Mixed-Mode Pixel Array Detector. Changes in the dislocation content within the deforming grains are monitored using the evolution of the full 3-D shapes of the diffraction spot intensity distributions in reciprocal space. The results for the Ti-7Al alloy show the presence of large stress fluctuations in contrast to AZ31, which shows a lesser degree of intermittent plastic flow.",https://aca.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5068756,[]

            Overlimiting current due to electro-diffusive amplification of the second Wien effect at a cation-anion bipolar membrane junction
                ","Numerical simulations are presented for the transient and steady-state response of a model electrodiffusive cell with a bipolar ion-selective membrane under electric current. The model uses a continuum Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory including source terms to account for the catalytic second Wien effect between ionogenic groups in the membranes and resolves the Debye layers at interfaces. The resulting electric field at the membrane junction is increased by as much as four orders of magnitude in comparison to the field external to the membrane. This leads to a significant amplification of the second Wien effect, creating an increased ionic flux due to the catalytic decomposition of water. The effect also induces an exaltation effect wherein the salt ion flux undergoes a concomitant increase as well. The interplay of effects results in a unique over-limiting current mechanism due to concentration polarization internal, rather than external, to the membranes. In addition to the case of two equal but oppositely charged membranes under the standard simplifying assumption of equal ionic diffusivities, two variations on this model are studied. Asymmetric diffusivities, representative of the actual mobility difference in dissociated water ions, and the effect of the membrane charge density ratio were also considered.

            An artificial placenta type microfluidic blood oxygenator with double-sided gas transfer microchannels and its integration as a neonatal lung assist device
                ","Preterm neonates suffering from respiratory distress syndrome require assistive support in the form of mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which may lead to long-term complications or even death. Here, we describe a high performance artificial placenta type microfluidic oxygenator, termed as a double-sided single oxygenator unit (dsSOU), which combines microwire stainless-steel mesh reinforced gas permeable membranes on both sides of a microchannel network, thereby significantly reducing the diffusional resistance to oxygen uptake as compared to the previous single-sided oxygenator designs. The new oxygenator is designed to be operated in a pumpless manner, perfused solely due to the arterio-venous pressure difference in a neonate and oxygenate blood through exposure directly to ambient atmosphere without any air or oxygen pumping. The best performing dsSOUs showed up to ∼343% improvement in oxygen transfer compared to a single-sided SOU (ssSOU) with the same height. Later, the dsSOUs were optimized and integrated to build a lung assist device (LAD) that could support the oxygenation needs for a 1–2 kg neonate under clinically relevant conditions for the artificial placenta, namely, flow rates ranging from 10 to 60 ml/min and a pressure drop of 10–60 mmHg. The LAD provided an oxygen uptake of 0.78–2.86 ml/min, which corresponded to the increase in oxygen saturation from 57 ± 1% to 93%–100%, under pure oxygen environment.

            Reconfiguring droplet interface bilayer networks through sacrificial membranes
                ","The droplet interface bilayer platform allows for the fabrication of stimuli-responsive microfluidic materials, using phospholipids as an organic surfactant in water-in-oil mixtures. In this approach, lipid-coated droplets are adhered together in arranged networks, forming lipid bilayer membranes with embedded transporters and establishing selective exchange pathways between neighboring aqueous subcompartments. The resulting material is a biologically inspired droplet-based material that exhibits emergent properties wherein different droplets accomplish different functions, similar to multicellular organisms. These networks have been successfully applied towards biomolecular sensing and energy harvesting applications. However, unlike their source of inspiration, these droplet structures are often static. This limitation not only renders the networks unable to adapt or modify their structure and function after formation but also limits their long term use as passive ionic exchange between neighboring droplet pairs may initiate immediately after the membranes are established. This work addresses this shortcoming by rupturing selected sacrificial membranes within the collections of droplets to rearrange the remaining droplets into new configurations, redirecting the droplet-droplet exchange pathways. This is accomplished through electrical shocks applied between selected droplets. Experimental outcomes are compared to predictions provided by a coupled mechanical-electrical model for the droplet networks, and then advanced configurations are proposed using this model.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5023386,[]

            Ultrafast time-resolved extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photoelectron spectroscopy of hole transfer in a Zn/n-GaP Schottky junction

While it is known that Schottky junctions decrease recombination by charge separation, measurements of the depletion region dynamics have remained elusive. Here, we use ultrafast pump-probe transient photoelectron spectroscopy to measure material-specific dynamics of the Zn/n-GaP(100) system. Through photoemission measurements the Schottky barrier height is determined to be 2.1 ± 0.1 eV at 10 monolayers of total Zn deposition. Transient photoemission measurements utilizing a 400 nm pump pulse show that, after excitation, holes are transferred from n-GaP(100) to the Zn overlayer within a few ps, as evidenced by shifts of the Zn 3d and Ga 3d core levels to higher binding energies. Within the timescale of the experiment (130 ps) no carrier recombination is observed in the junction.

            Reducing deposition of encrustation in ureteric stents by changing the stent architecture: A microfluidic-based investigation
                ","Ureteric stents are clinically deployed to retain ureteral patency in the presence of an obstruction of the ureter lumen. Despite the fact that multiple stent designs have been researched in recent years, encrustation and biofilm-associated infections remain significant complications of ureteral stenting, potentially leading to the functional failure of the stent. It has been suggested that “inactive” side-holes of stents may act as anchoring sites for encrusting crystals, as they are associated with low wall shear stress (WSS) levels. Obstruction of side-holes due to encrustation is particularly detrimental to the function of the stent, since holes provide a path for urine to by-pass the occlusion. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop novel stents to reduce deposition of encrusting particles at side-holes. In this study, we employed a stent-on-chip microfluidic model of the stented and occluded ureter to investigate the effect of stent architecture on WSS distribution and encrustation over its surface. Variations in the stent geometry encompassed (i) the wall thickness and (ii) the shape of side-holes. Stent thickness was varied in the range 0.3-0.7 mm, while streamlined side-holes of triangular shape were evaluated (with a vertex angle in the range 45°-120°). Reducing the thickness of the stent increased WSS and thus reduced the encrustation rate at side-holes. A further improvement in performance was achieved by using side-holes with a triangular shape; notably, a 45° vertex angle showed superior performance compared to other angles investigated, resulting in a significant increase in WSS within “inactive” side-holes. In conclusion, combining the optimal stent thickness (0.3 mm) and hole vertex angle (45°) resulted in a ∼90% reduction in encrustation rate within side-holes, compared to a standard design. If translated to a full-scale ureteric stent, this optimised architecture has the potential for significantly increasing the stent lifetime while reducing clinical complications.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5059370,[]

However, broadly applicable experimental means to quantitatively map such structural distortion on their intrinsic ultrafast time and nanometer length scales are still lacking. Here, we introduce ultrafast convergent beam electron diffraction with a nanoscale probe beam for the quantitative retrieval of the time-dependent local deformation gradient tensor. We demonstrate its capabilities by investigating the ultrafast acoustic deformations close to the edge of a single-crystalline graphite membrane. Tracking the structural distortion with a 28-nm/700-fs spatio-temporal resolution, we observe an acoustic membrane breathing mode with spatially modulated amplitude, governed by the optical near field structure at the membrane edge. Furthermore, an in-plane polarized acoustic shock wave is launched at the membrane edge, which triggers secondary acoustic shear waves with a pronounced spatio-temporal dependency. The experimental findings are compared to numerical acoustic wave simulations in the continuous medium limit, highlighting the importance of microscopic dissipation mechanisms and ballistic transport channels.",https://aca.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5009822,[]

            High-throughput culture and embedment of spheroid array using droplet contact-based spheroid transfer
                ","Spheroids are one of the most representative models of 3D cell culture, which can be easily formed using conventional hanging drop method. However, medium change and spheroid transferring process are the bottlenecks that reduce the throughput of the entire process in the hanging drop culture. In addition, the embedment of spheroid into hydrogel still depends on the individual pipetting process. To overcome these issues, we present poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based simple devices which can exploit droplet contact-based spheroid transfer using a drop array chip (DAC) having an array of well structures and peripheral rims. When the upper spheroid-containing drops were in contact with the lower liquid drops, the air–liquid interface disappeared at the merged surface and the spheroids settled down due to gravitational force. This method was applied to repetitive medium change and live/dead staining of spheroids cultured with the hanging drop method. To simultaneously embed the spheroids into the corresponding collagen hydrogel drops, a PDMS-based pillar array chip (PAC) was contacted in advance with the spheroid-containing DAC. The contacted PAC then contained the spheroids trapped in small drops of liquid reduced in volume to around 0.5 ",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5039965,[]

            Time-of-flight electron energy loss spectroscopy by longitudinal phase space manipulation with microwave cavities

Resolving small energy losses with ultrashort electron pulses, however, is an enormous challenge due to the low average brightness of a pulsed beam. In this paper, we propose to use time-of-flight measurements combined with longitudinal phase space manipulation using resonant microwave cavities. This allows for both an accurate detection of energy losses with a high current throughput and efficient monochromation. First, a proof-of-principle experiment is presented, showing that with the incorporation of a compression cavity the flight time resolution can be improved significantly. Then, it is shown through simulations that by adding a cavity-based monochromation technique, a full-width-at-half-maximum energy resolution of 22 meV can be achieved with 3.1 ps pulses at a beam energy of 30 keV with currently available technology. By combining state-of-the-art energy resolutions with a pulsed electron beam, the technique proposed here opens up the way to detecting short-lived excitations within the regime of highly collective physics.",https://aca.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5052217,[]

            Heterogeneity in relaxation rate improves the synchronization of oscillatory neurons in a model of the SCN
                ","The circadian rhythms in mammals, that are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, have been observed even in the absence of a light-dark cycle. The SCN is composed of about 10 000 autonomous neuronal oscillators, which are heterogenous in many oscillatory properties, including the heterogeneity in relaxation rates. Although the relaxation rate affects the entrainability of the SCN as a whole, not much is known about the reasons why the heterogeneity in relaxation rate exists. In the present study, based on a Poincaré model, we examine whether the heterogeneity in the relaxation rate affects the synchronization of the SCN neuronal oscillators under constant darkness. Both our simulations and theoretical results show that the heterogeneity improves the synchronization. Our findings provide an alternative explanation for the existence of the heterogeneity in the SCN neurons and shed light on the effect of neuronal heterogeneity on the collective behavior of the SCN neurons.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5052299,[]

            Anatomy of leadership in collective behaviour
                ","Understanding the mechanics behind the coordinated movement of mobile animal groups (collective motion) provides key insights into their biology and ecology, while also yielding algorithms for bio-inspired technologies and autonomous systems. It is becoming increasingly clear that many mobile animal groups are composed of heterogeneous individuals with differential levels and types of influence over group behaviors. The ability to infer this differential influence, or leadership, is critical to understanding group functioning in these collective animal systems. Due to the broad interpretation of leadership, many different measures and mathematical tools are used to describe and infer “leadership,” e.g., position, causality, influence, and information flow. But a key question remains: which, if any, of these concepts actually describes leadership? We argue that instead of asserting a single definition or notion of leadership, the complex interaction rules and dynamics typical of a group imply that leadership itself is not merely a binary classification (leader or follower), but rather, a complex combination of many different components. In this paper, we develop an anatomy of leadership, identify several principal components, and provide a general mathematical framework for discussing leadership. With the intricacies of this taxonomy in mind, we present a set of leadership-oriented toy models that should be used as a proving ground for leadership inference methods going forward. We believe this multifaceted approach to leadership will enable a broader understanding of leadership and its inference from data in mobile animal groups and beyond.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5024395,[]

Each aspect is illustrated with simple examples including unobserved variables, sampling issues, determinism, stationarity, nonlinearity, measurement error, and significance testing. The effects of dynamical noise, autocorrelation, and high dimensionality are highlighted in comparison studies of common causal reconstruction methods.

In the strongly perturbed case, we observe a phase dependent perturbation threshold required to elicit an immediate spike and use this behavior for our analytical predictions. Resulting upper bounds on the critical coupling strength agree well with our experimental observations and numerical simulations. Furthermore, important system parameters which determine synchronization are different in the weak and strong coupling regimes.

            Control of voltage-driven instabilities in cardiac myocytes with memory
                ","Sudden cardiac death is known to be associated with dynamical instabilities in the heart, and thus control of dynamical instabilities is considered a potential therapeutic strategy. Different control methods were developed previously, including time-delayed feedback pacing control and constant diastolic interval pacing control. Experimental, theoretical, and simulation studies have examined the efficacy of these control methods in stabilizing action potential dynamics. In this study, we apply these control methods to control complex action potential (AP) dynamics under two diseased conditions: early repolarization syndrome and long QT syndrome, in which voltage-driven instabilities occur in the presence of short-term cardiac memory. In addition, we also develop a feedback pacing method to stabilize these instabilities. We perform theoretical analyses using iterated map models and carry out numerical simulations of AP models. We show that under the normal condition where the memory effect is minimal, all three methods can effectively control the action potential duration (APD) dynamics. Under the two diseased conditions where the memory effect is exacerbated, constant diastolic pacing control is least effective, while the feedback pacing control is most effective. Under a very strong memory effect, all three methods fail to stabilize the voltage-driven instabilities. The failure of effective control is due to memory and the all-or-none AP dynamics which results in very steep changes in APD.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5040854,[]

            Synchronization of stochastic hybrid oscillators driven by a common switching environment
                ","Many systems in biology, physics, and chemistry can be modeled through ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are piecewise smooth, but switch between different states according to a Markov jump process. In the fast switching limit, the dynamics converges to a deterministic ODE. In this paper, we suppose that this limit ODE supports a stable limit cycle. We demonstrate that a set of such oscillators can synchronize when they are uncoupled, but they share the same switching Markov jump process. The latter is taken to represent the effect of a common randomly switching environment. We determine the leading order of the Lyapunov coefficient governing the rate of decay of the phase difference in the fast switching limit. The analysis bears some similarities to the classical analysis of synchronization of stochastic oscillators subject to common white noise. However, the discrete nature of the Markov jump process raises some difficulties: in fact, we find that the Lyapunov coefficient from the quasi-steady-state approximation differs from the Lyapunov coefficient one obtains from a second order perturbation expansion in the waiting time between jumps. Finally, we demonstrate synchronization numerically in the radial isochron clock model and show that the latter Lyapunov exponent is more accurate.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5054795,[]

The dissipation process occurring during magnetization/demagnetization is described by a power-law potential, which leads to rate-independence at a certain limit of the rate-dependent exponent. The incorporation of isotropic hardening in the model enables us to describe phenomenologically at the macroscopic scale both nucleation and pinning type constitutive responses. We further model the symmetric and asymmetric minor loops by employing the idea of a bounding surface, which was originally introduced in the context of mechanical plasticity. Our model shows a very good agreement with experiments for spark plasma sintered NdFeB magnets, where nucleation is found to be the primary mechanism of coercivity. We also use our model to probe experiments for melt-spun NdFeB ribbons and powders, where both nucleation and pinning mechanisms are experimentally found to be significant. Moreover, we correlate the proposed model parameters with the underlying mechanisms for coercivity. We investigate the predictive capability of the proposed model by first probing an experimental minor loop and then use it to successfully predict the remaining minor loops, obtained from that experiment.

Not only do magnetic skyrmions—magnetic whirls with a           unique topology—reveal fundamentally new physics, but they have also risen to prominence           as up-and-coming candidates for next-generation high-density efficient information           encoding. Within a few years, it has been possible to efficiently create, manipulate, and           destroy nanometer-size skyrmions in device-compatible materials at room-temperature by all           electrical means.

                ","A computational framework for predicting phonon frequencies, group velocities, scattering rates, and the resulting lattice thermal conductivity is described. The underlying theory and implementation suggestions are also provided. By using input from first principles calculations and taking advantage of advances in computational power, this framework has enabled thermal conductivity predictions that agree with experimental measurements for diverse crystalline materials over a wide range of temperatures. Density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations are first used to obtain the harmonic and cubic force constants. The harmonic force constants are the input to harmonic lattice dynamics calculations, which provide the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors. The harmonic properties and the cubic force constants are then used with perturbation theory and/or phenomenological models to determine intrinsic and extrinsic scattering rates. The full set of phonon properties is then used to solve the Boltzmann transport equation for the mode populations and thermal conductivity. The extension of the framework to include higher-order processes, capture finite temperature effects, and model alloys is described. A case study on silicon is presented that provides benchmarking and convergence data.

            Time-dependent characteristics of secondary electron emission
                ","The recent development of the time-resolving capability for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enables it to be a real 4D space-time imaging technique, which is extremely suitable for investigating the ultrafast dynamic processes concerned with secondary electron emission (SEE). This paper attempts to investigate the dynamic SEE process with the aid of a Monte Carlo method; the understanding of the mechanism will surely benefit the construction and application of various kinds of time-resolved SEMs. Our simulation modeling is based on the use of the Mott cross section and a dielectric function approach for the respective description of the electron elastic and inelastic scattering. One secondary electron is assumed to be produced in an inelastic scattering event, and the owned kinetic energy enables it to transport and produce other secondary electrons, forming the cascade production process. From the simulation, not only the time delay of SEE from the incidence instant of primary electrons but also the time dependences of the involved physical quantities, including the energy-, depth-, direction-, emission site-, and production site-distributions can be theoretically derived. The calculations provide useful knowledge on the time dependence of SEE from the theoretical perspective for the applications to the available time-resolved SEMs.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5080264,[]

            Investigation and modeling of optics damage in high-power laser systems caused by light backscattered in plasma at the target
                ","High-power laser facilities may be restricted in operations by the risk of damage to optics due to the backscattering of laser light from the intended target. A portion of this backscattered light can re-enter the beam line and at sufficient fluence may damage (burn) optical apparatus. Here, the observed cumulative burn pattern on mirrors at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) due to stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) at the target is explained using detailed simulations. Our methodology involves using a measurement of a phase plate profile installed at the NIF to provide the laser input to a three-dimensional simulation of laser-plasma interaction in a target typical of that fielded at the NIF. Light scattered by SBS at the target is then followed back to the final aperture of the beam line, back through the phase plate, and to a mirror where damage typically occurs. We find that mirror damage patterns are largely dictated by the phase imprint of the phase plate on the returning SBS light. Our simulations show that the instantaneous SBS signal at the mirror varies on a picosecond time scale and is also highly modulated in space. Temporal averaging of the simulated SBS light pattern on the mirror reveals a pattern in close agreement with the experimentally observed damage. Understanding these burn patterns (distribution, modulation depth) may lead to future phase plate designs that limit damage throughout the optics assembly of high-powered laser facilities.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5070066,[]

In this work, we show that for femtosecond laser and electron pulses, the increase in required laser intensities due to the low QE drives the photocathode electronic distribution far from static equilibrium. We adapt an existing dynamic model of the electron occupation under high intensity laser illumination to predict the time-dependent effects of the nonequilibrium electron distribution on the QE, mean transverse energy (MTE), and emission brightness of metal photocathodes. We find that multiphoton photoemission dramatically alters the MTE as compared to thermal equilibrium models, causing the MTE to no longer be a monotonic function of photon excess energy.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5053082,[]

We apply both the transition-potential half-core-hole approach and the complex polarization propagator using four different models of the crystal with increasing oxygen and proton disorder but find poor agreement with experiments. We note that there are large variations in experimental spectra depending on detection mode and how the ice samples were prepared, which leads us to critically investigate what structures were actually prepared and measured in each case. This is done by using a Monte Carlo-based fitting technique which fits the spectra based on a library of precomputed spectra and assigns weights to contributions from different model structures. These are then used to generate O–O and O–H radial distribution functions and tetrahedrality parameters associated with each of the measured spectra. We find that all spectra are associated with sharp peaks at the oxygen positions in the perfect lattice, but with significant disorder around these positions. We suggest that presently available XAS of hexagonal ice are not fully representative of the perfect crystalline lattice, but contain varying amounts of defects and possible contributions from low-density amorphous ice.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5078385,[]

Asymptotically linear scaling with molecule size is achieved with an atomic orbital based formulation, integral screening methods, and sparse linear algebra. In addition, we introduce an ansatz that exploits the locality of the contributions to the g-tensor for molecules with local spin density. For such systems, sublinear scaling is obtained by restricting the magnetic field perturbation to the relevant subspaces of the full atomic orbital space; several criteria for selecting these subspaces are discussed and compared. It is shown that the computational cost of g-tensor calculations with the local approach can fall below the cost of the self-consistent field calculation for large molecules.

            Utilization of ICE exhaust gas as a heat source for pyrolysis of natural rubber as automobile fuel
                ","This research determined the gain of thermal efficiency of an internal combustion engine when its exhaust gas was utilized as a heat source for natural rubber pyrolysis. A 350-cc motorcycle engine was selected as a testing engine for carrying out the experiments. Its exhaust system was modified to have a pyrolyser fixed inside, and the exhaust heat was transferred through its surface toward the NR samples to cause pyrolysis. The exhaust port was designed to flare in order to reduce the exhaust velocity. Its static temperature was thus increased, which increased driving heat inside the pyrolyser. In case of determination of the NR pyrolysis rate, the NR samples were heated by the exhaust coming up by keeping the gear status at idle and setting an rpm value of 3200. The amount of the obtained NR pyrolysis products was plotted against time. Pyrolysis rates at each interval of time were determined and also plotted against the point of time, whereas the amount of gasoline consumed under the same interval of time was used to calculate the consumption rate. In the case of determination of the amount of heat recovery from the exhaust for the pyrolysis, a diffential scanning calorimeter-thermogravimetric analyser (DSC-TGA) hybrid was used as a pyrolyser instead of the modified engine, and the samples were run at the same temperature and under the same CO",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5045246,[]

            Performance estimation of Savonius wind and Savonius hydrokinetic turbines under identical power input
                ","In the context of energy crisis, extensive depletion of fossil fuel, and climate change, the vertical-axis Savonius-type wind or hydrokinetic turbines appear to be promising candidates to extract energy from wind or free-flowing water because of their superior self-starting capability and design simplicity. The present investigation focuses on comparative analysis between Savonius wind turbines (SWTs) and Savonius hydrokinetic turbines (SHTs) at the same input power. To accomplish this, two configurations are considered, viz., 2-bladed and 3-bladed turbine designs having semicircular blade profiles. Experimental studies revealed that the SWTs operate in a slightly wider range of tip-speed ratios than the SHTs. It is also observed that, like SHTs, 2-bladed SWTs result in an improved (47%) peak power coefficient (C",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5054075,[]

            New approach for maximizing generation and optimal utilization of available space for solar PV system
                ","To accomplish an enormous demand of power with solar energy, a cost effective and optimum system has to be developed which works in synchronisation with the existing grid. The Government in developing countries like India is providing momentous opportunities and marvellous schemes to promote renewable energy sources like solar for generating power. This paper aims to analyse the generation of power from solar photovoltaic (PV) systems economically and efficiently as it is always a challenge for the design engineer to develop an economical and efficient solar PV system. Apart from technical issues, structural aspects also affect the power generation from PV modules. This paper proposes an innovative design of non-movable tracking system that enhances the power generation of PV modules by just providing two grooves in the mounting structure in place of the tracking system. A formula for the optimum space calculation for PV installation is also proposed in this paper. A comparative analysis of total annual energy generated by the hardware setup and the results obtained using software of the rooftop solar PV system has also been analysed for practical consideration. To verify the results, first, the system has been simulated using the PVSYST software considering all practical and existing realistic losses like PV loss due to irradiance and temperature, array soil loss, module quality loss, array mismatch loss, ohmic wiring loss, and inverter loss which formulate a bonafide case of consideration and then hardware implementation of the proposed system. The hardware and software results have been compared to analyse the proposed topologies adopted to address the aforesaid problems.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5007780,[]

            Electrical response of thermoelectric generator to geometry variation under transient thermal boundary condition

With the consideration of a defined reference geometry, different heat flux frequencies are applied in order to evaluate the corresponding electrical output by the TEG. In addition, variation of the module performance for various TEG leg lengths and its cross-sectional area are studied over a wide range of heat fluxes. The results indicate that the open circuit voltage in the experiment is in a good agreement with the open circuit voltage in the simulation results.

            The use of modeling in drawing up guidelines for the exploitation of the           Khankala geothermal field (Chechen Republic)

            Clustering-based computation of degradation rate for photovoltaic systems
                ","For effective utilization of solar energy, performance monitoring of photovoltaic (PV) systems is required. Two important research goals are to maximize the power output from PV systems and further reduce the economic losses. This paper proposes a model using a clustering-based technique to evaluate the degradation of PV panels with different topologies. Here, the performance ratio (PR) of the PV panels is estimated without physical inspection on-site, making the proposed model beneficial for real-time estimation of the PR and in turn for more robust forecasting of the PV power output. The present work utilizes the segmental K-means clustering technique to obtain clusters of input meteorological data sharing similar features. Various forms of meteorological data, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, dew point, solar radiation, and sunshine hours, are given as the input, and solar power data are the output of the proposed model. The proposed model calculates the degradation in output solar power in terms of PR for panels with three different topologies, namely, amorphous silicon (a-Si), polycrystalline silicon (p-Si), and hetero-junction with an intrinsic thin layer (HIT), over a period of three years. The degradation rate produced by a-Si technology was lowest, and it was highest for HIT technology. The results obtained showed good agreement with the standard method used for performance evaluation in a similar earlier study. The proposed model has the advantage over other methods that real-time estimation is possible, as this method does not require physical inspection and imaging, which is essential in other techniques.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5042688,[]

However, there are four possible zigzag edge terminations in contrast to graphene where only one type of zigzag termination is possible. Determining the boundary conditions for these lattice terminations, the energy spectra of pseudospin-1 fermions in dice model ribbons with zigzag and armchair boundary conditions are found. It is shown that the energy levels for armchair ribbons display the same features as in graphene except the zero energy flat band inherent to the dice model. In addition, unlike graphene, there are no propagating edge states local-ized at the zigzag boundary and there are specific zigzag terminations which give rise to bulk modes of a metallic type in dice model ribbons.

            Nucleation and propagation of thermomagnetic avalanches in thin-film superconductors (Review Article)
                ","Stability of the vortex matter—magnetic flux lines penetrating into the material—in type-II superconductor films is crucially important for their application. If some vortices get detached from pinning centres, the energy dissipated by their motion will facilitate further depinning, and may trigger an electromagnetic breakdown. In this paper, we review recent theoretical and experimental results on development of the above mentioned thermomagnetic instability. Starting from linear stability analysis for the initial critical-state flux distribution we then discuss a numerical procedure allowing to analyze developed flux avalanches. As an example of this approach we consider ultra-fast dendritic flux avalanches in thin superconducting disks. At the initial stage the flux front corresponding to the dendrite's trunk moves with velocity up to 100 km/s. At later stage the almost constant velocity leads to a specific propagation regime similar to ray optics. We discuss this regime observed in superconducting films coated by normal strips. Finally, we discuss dramatic enhancement of the anisotropy of the flux patterns due to specific dynamics. In this way we demonstrate that the combination of the linear stability analysis with the numerical approach provides an efficient framework for understanding the ultra-fast coupled nonlocal dynamics of electromagnetic fields and dissipation in superconductor films.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5037549,[]

                ","This article attempts a point-by-point review of the electron spectrum of graphene containing defects (adsorbed atoms, substitutional atoms, vacancies) that can be adequately described within the Lifshitz model. In this regard, the known Hamiltonian for this model is calculated for the case of two-dimensional relativistic electrons, and the criteria for occurrence of an impurity resonance near a Dirac point are given. The theory of concentration band structure transformation of graphene is presented, from which it follows that a transport gap is opened upon reaching a strictly defined value of impurity concentration in the neighborhood of the energy of impurity resonance. At the same time, the question of the possibility (or impossibility) of localization in such a {spatially disordered system} of Dirac quasiparticles is analyzed. Based on this, it is possible to provide an explanation and present a description of a phenomenon recently observed in {impure graphene}, the metal-dielectric transition that appears as a direct consequence of the decrease of the Fermi energy of the system in the region of a transport gap. The concept of local spectrum rearrangement of graphene, which also occurs during the process of increased concentration of defects in it, is introduced and substantiated. Physical reasons are formulated, by which the position of the minimum of the low-temperature conductivity of graphene as a function of the Fermi energy of electrons corresponds to the impurity resonance energy rather than to the Dirac point, as has been validated in a number of theoretical and test studies. Here, it appears that the minimum value is not a universal magnitude, but depends on the concentration of defects. Analytical examination of impurity effects is accompanied by numerical modeling of the system under study, as a result of which complete correspondence has been established between these two approaches. In particular, the overall picture of spectrum rearrangement, localization of electron states, and also the effects having local nature are confirmed.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5060964,[]

            Understanding non-covalent interactions in larger molecular complexes from first principles
                ","Non-covalent interactions pervade all matter and play a fundamental role in layered materials, biological systems, and large molecular complexes. Despite this, our accumulated understanding of non-covalent interactions to date has been mainly developed in the tens-of-atoms molecular regime. This falls considerably short of the scales at which we would like to understand energy trends, structural properties, and temperature dependencies in materials where non-covalent interactions have an appreciable role. However, as more reference information is obtained beyond moderately sized molecular systems, our understanding is improving and we stand to gain pertinent insights by tackling more complex systems, such as supramolecular complexes, molecular crystals, and other soft materials. In addition, accurate reference information is needed to provide the drive for extending the predictive power of more efficient workhorse methods, such as density functional approximations that also approximate van der Waals dispersion interactions. In this perspective, we discuss the first-principles approaches that have been used to obtain reference interaction energies for beyond modestly sized molecular complexes. The methods include quantum Monte Carlo, symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, non-canonical coupled cluster theory, and approaches based on the random-phase approximation. By considering the approximations that underpin each method, the most accurate theoretical references for supramolecular complexes and molecular crystals to date are ascertained. With these, we also assess a handful of widely used exchange-correlation functionals in density functional theory. The discussion culminates in a framework for putting into perspective the accuracy of high-level wavefunction-based methods and identifying future challenges.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5075487,[]

            Potential implementation of reservoir computing models based on magnetic skyrmions
                ",Reservoir Computing is a type of recursive neural network commonly used for recognizing and predicting spatio-temporal events relying on a complex hierarchy of nested feedback loops to generate a memory functionality. The Reservoir Computing paradigm does not require any knowledge of the reservoir topology or node weights for training purposes and can therefore utilize naturally existing networks formed by a wide variety of physical processes. Most efforts to implement reservoir computing prior to this have focused on utilizing memristor techniques to implement recursive neural networks. This paper examines the potential of magnetic skyrmion fabrics and the complex current patterns which form in them as an attractive physical instantiation for Reservoir Computing. We argue that their nonlinear dynamical interplay resulting from anisotropic magnetoresistance and spin-torque effects allows for an effective and energy efficient nonlinear processing of spatial temporal events with the aim of event recognition and prediction.,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5006918,[]

            Tunable ferromagnetic resonance in La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites at millimeter wave frequencies
                ","Transmittance measurements have been performed on La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites in millimeter waves. Broadband millimeter-wave measurements have been carried out using the free space quasi-optical spectrometer, equipped with a set of high power backward wave oscillators covering the frequency range of 30 – 120 GHz. Strong absorption zones have been observed in the millimeter-wave transmittance spectra of all La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites due to the ferromagnetic resonance. Linear shift of ferromagnetic resonance frequency as functions of La-Co substitutions have been found. Real and imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity of La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites have been calculated using the analysis of recorded high precision transmittance spectra. Frequency dependences of magnetic permeability of La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites, as well as saturation magnetization and anisotropy field have been determined based on Schlömann’s theory for partially magnetized ferrites. La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites have been further investigated by DC magnetization to assess magnetic behavior and compare with millimeter wave data. Consistency of saturation magnetization determined independently by both millimeter wave absorption and DC magnetization have been found for all La-Co substituted barium hexaferrites.

            On the permeability of colloidal gels
                ","We reexamine and refine analytical theories for permeability in colloidal networks, with particular focus on constants and identification of approximations. The new theories are compared against numerical simulations of Stokes flow through the networks and reveal nearly quantitative power-law predictions for both pore size and permeability at low volume fractions, with systematic deviations observed only at high volume fractions. Comparison with two previously published experimental data sets yields mixed results: in one case, very good agreement is found, while in the other, only the scaling is correctly predicted. In fractal gel networks, the permeability is commonly modeled as a power-law function of volume fraction, with the fractal dimension of the network determining the power-law exponent. To quantitatively probe the influence of gel structure on permeability, we investigate this relation in structures generated by diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) and reaction-limited cluster aggregation (RLCA) and, for contrast, non-overlapping uniform random dispersions of particles. Geometric analyses are used to determine network pore size distributions, fractal dimensions, and percolation characteristics. High-fidelity simulations of the slow viscous flow of Newtonian fluids are used to obtain first-principles-based velocity and fields and hence network permeabilities. Interestingly, the effective pore size that determines permeability is found to be somewhat larger than that measured by a method based on the insertion of spherical probes. Empirical inclusion of a fractal dimension dependence on volume fraction is found to yield quantitative results for permeabilities over the entire volume fraction range studied, in both DLCA and RLCA materials.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5054596,[]

            Transport phenomena in bispherical coordinates

Here, we address this restriction on available geometries for transport phenomena by adding bispherical coordinates to the growing list of coordinate systems for which the equations of change have been developed. Bispherical coordinates allow us to solve transport problems between eccentric spheres or horns, which spherical coordinates cannot handle. We thus develop the equations of change for this coordinate system and provide three worked examples showing how to get new exact solutions to momentum, heat, and mass transfer problems.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5054581,[]

            Coalescence dynamics of unequal sized drops
                ","In this study, coalescence dynamics of two unequal sized drops of the same liquid have been investigated using the coupled level set and volume of fluid method. A broad range of fluid properties is considered with two orders of magnitude variation of Ohnesorge numbers and Atwood number ranging between 0.01 and 0.9976. The pinch-off process and controlling parameters that lead to satellite generation have been investigated. The capillary waves are generated as a result of the sharp curvature produced near the contact region. Here we demonstrate that the capillary waves propagating along the interface of the lower drop can affect the eventual pinch-off of the satellite. The local curvature of the neck plays a crucial role in the pinch-off process. A sharper axial curvature of the neck increases the local capillary pressure which restricts the pinch-off. The critical diameter ratio above which a satellite pinches off during the coalescence of two free-falling drops increases with increasing relative strength of the viscous force and the gravity force. The critical ratio can be as low as 1.2 at a lower relative strength of the viscous and the gravity forces. The coalescence of two unequal sized drops may produce much smaller satellite drops, on account of coalescence in successive steps, with or without intermediate detachment.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5064516,[]

            Wake structures behind a rotor with superhydrophobic-coated blades at low Reynolds number
                ","We experimentally investigate the flow structures generated by a rotor with the superhydrophobic coating applied on the blade surface in static water. Considered Reynolds number based on the rotating velocity and blade tip to tip distance is 96 000, and spray coating of hydrophobic nanoparticles is used to produce a superhydrophobic surface. We focus on the changes in both instantaneous and time-/ensemble-averaged flows measured with a stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The vortical structures behind a rotor is characterized by the periodic shedding of hub and tip vortices, whose interactions induce a cone-shaped low-speed region where higher velocities are induced over it. These are closely connected to the spatial distribution of velocity fluctuation. With superhydrophobic surface, the organized formation of vortical structures is disturbed due to the slip on the blade surface, that is, the accumulation of vorticity on the surface is delayed or not strong. Thus the conical region shrinks toward the rotation axis, and the vortex strength is reduced. As a result, about 20% reduction in the turbulent kinetic energy is achieved in the wake, followed by smaller decrease (∼6%) in the streamwise momentum flux. Also, it is found that superhydrophobic surface on the pressure side is more effective, in terms of turbulence reduction. This is the first study to investigate the effect of superhydrophobic surface on the flow around a rotating body, and we think the results will be useful to extend the application of superhydrophobic surface.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5054039,[]

            Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for complex fluid flows: Recent developments in methodology and applications

            A numerical study of oscillation induced coalescence in bubbly flows

Ignoring gravity, the two- and three-dimensional flows of equal-sized bubbles are driven by periodically oscillating pressure gradients in the X and Z directions with the same amplitude and frequency but different phases. The results show that the oscillations will drive the bubbles together, promoting coalescence. The results depend on the amplitude and frequency, resulting in “crawling” flow, “revolving” flow, and “oscillating” flow. As the amplitude increases, the critical frequency separating these three flow regions increases. For each amplitude, there is an optimum frequency near the transition region between the crawling flow and the revolving flow that yields the fastest coalescence. A qualitative comparison between two- and three-dimensional flows shows that the dynamics observed for the two-dimensional flows is also found in three-dimensions.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5059558,[]

            A versatile lattice Boltzmann model for immiscible ternary fluid flows
                ","We propose a lattice Boltzmann color-gradient model for immiscible ternary fluid flows, which is applicable to the fluids with a full range of interfacial tensions, especially in near-critical and critical states. An interfacial force for N-phase systems is derived and then introduced into the model using a body force scheme, which helps reduce spurious velocities. A generalized recoloring algorithm is applied to produce phase segregation and ensure immiscibility of three different fluids, where an enhanced form of segregation parameters is derived by considering the existence of Neumann’s triangle and the effect of the equilibrium contact angle in a three-phase junction. The proposed model is first validated by two typical examples, namely, the Young-Laplace test for a compound droplet and the spreading of a droplet between two stratified fluids. It is then used to study the structure and stability of double droplets in a static matrix. Consistent with the theoretical stability diagram, seven possible equilibrium morphologies are successfully reproduced by adjusting the interfacial tension ratio. By simulating near-critical and critical states of double droplets where the outcomes are very sensitive to the model accuracy, we show that the present model is advantageous to three-phase flow simulations and allows for accurate simulation of near-critical and critical states. Finally, we investigate the influence of interfacial tension ratio on the behavior of a compound droplet in a three-dimensional shear flow, and four different deformation and breakup modes are observed.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5056765,[]

Here, wavelets are used to study the onset and subsequent transition to fully developed turbulence from a laminar state. Originally applied to neutral fluid turbulence, an iterative wavelet technique decomposes the field into coherent and incoherent contributions. In contrast to Fourier power spectra, finite time Lyapunov exponents, and simple measures of intermittency such as non-Gaussian statistics of field increments, the wavelet technique is found to provide a quantitative measure for the onset of turbulence and to track the transition to fully developed turbulence. The wavelet method makes no assumptions about the structure of the coherent current sheets or the underlying plasma model. Temporal evolution of the coherent and incoherent wavelet fluctuations is found to be highly correlated (a Pearson correlation coefficient of ",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5062853,[]

            Parameter estimation of linear frequency modulation signals based on sampling theorem and fractional broadening
                ","Linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals are a class of important radar signals, but it is difficult to estimate their parameters in electronic warfare. Fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is one of the most important methods for estimating the parameters of LFM signals, but the computational efficiency is strongly influenced by the search range and evaluation of the optimum FRFT order. To improve the estimation speed, we present a novel method for the parameter estimation of LFM signals using sampling theorem and fractional broadening. First, sampling theorem is used to calculate the search range of the optimum FRFT transform order. Then, the LFM signals are transformed by FRFT in the search range. Finally, the fractional broadening of the LFM signals is calculated, and the optimum FRFT order is obtained according to the relationship between the fractional broadening and the FRFT order. Experiments are performed to compare the proposed method and the traditional FRFT method. The results show that the proposed method is six times faster than the traditional FRFT method while preserving the accuracy. Moreover, it can quickly and accurately achieve the parameter estimation of multi-component LFM signals in the case of white Gaussian noise with a low signal-to-noise ratio.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5041031,[]

We calculate the carrier effective masses and report smaller values for the holes than the electrons, indicating higher hole mobility and easier p-type doping. The small difference between the static and high frequency dielectric constants indicates that BAs is only weakly ionic. We also observe that the imaginary part of the dielectric function exhibits a strong absorption peak, which corresponds to parallel bands in the band structure.

            Annihilation of the pacemaking activity in the sinoatrial node cell and tissue
                ","Sinus node arrest is a dangerous disease, which is associated with the annihilation of the cardiac biological oscillators. The present work investigates in detail the pacemaking annihilation of the modeled single SAN cell and heterogeneous tissue by the conventional nonlinear dynamics approach. It is found that annihilation should generally exist in the SAN system, which is due to the subcritical Hopf bifurcation. However, the annihilation is strict with the stimulus and the physiological parameters, for which the difficulty is estimated. Intracellular calcium cycling makes the pacemaking more robust against annihilation. Furthermore, some general methods for exploring the annihilation dynamics are demonstrated, which may be helpful for the investigations of the other complex biological oscillators. The present work may provide suggestive ideas for the treatments of the sinus arrest and the relevant arrhythmogenesis.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5051509,[]

            Artificial intelligence-based inspection of contact shock of a functional protein on a silicon substrate
                ","For the development of next-generation biomedical devices, it is necessary to understand the precise interactions between proteins and solid surfaces. However, current approaches only allow these interactions to be roughly estimated. Here, using artificial intelligence-based targeting and computer simulations, we assessed the binding behavior of approximately 80 tetrapeptides in the active site of papain adsorbed on a semiconductor surface. The contact shock of papain resulted in different peptides becoming compatible (i.e. fitting into the active site) and others losing this compatibility. Therefore, we propose contact shock as a potentially powerful approach to modify protein function. Moreover, the structural information for tetrapeptides that were insensitive to structural changes of papain could be valuable for drug design. From our decision trees, we found that the shock changed the main factors that determined compatibility.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5080696,[]

            Pulsed laser ablation of bulk target and particle products in liquid for nanomaterial fabrication
                ","Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) is gradually becoming an attractive approach for nanomaterial fabrication because it is a chemically simple and clean method with high product purity. We studied the laser interaction with bulk target and particle products in detail, including mechanism process, target morphology and nanoparticle products. We captured three oscillations of one bubble after laser ablates the bulk target and calculated the variation of pressure and temperature inside the bubble. The results show that the first bubble oscillation has greatest impact on the nanomaterial synthesis, and the most powerful stages for the material synthesis during all the bubble oscillations are the beginning of each expansions and the end of each shrinks. Nanomaterial releases from the bubble at the end of each oscillations. In addition, based on the analysis of ablation cavity on the target, it is found that the cavity depth increases with the number of laser pulses, and then the depth tends to be under saturation status, which means it is difficult to obtain great improvement of the nanomaterial productivity just by prolonging the laser irradiation time. More importantly, the strong interaction between laser and particle products is presented clearly by time-resolved shadowgraphy, which can contributed to the modification of nanoparticle products.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5082695,[]

The dynamical pinning sites are realized by a skyrmion carrying wire, where the skyrmion repulsion is used in order to keep the skyrmions at equal distances.

            Microstructure and magnetic properties of ultrathin FePt granular films

However, FePt films show degraded magnetic properties when the grain size is reduced to this scale, which cannot be explained solely by the finite size theory. In this study, we explored the structural cause of property degradation by employing advanced electron microscopy and atomistic modeling. Structural features unique to the nanostructured FePt granular films at significantly reduced grain sizes of 2∼8 nm were studied by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy with geometric aberrations corrected up to the third order. Two critical structural parameters, the threshold grain size corresponding to the upper size limit of the FePt grains with zero chemical ordering and the sub-nanometer thin interfacial impurity at grain boundaries, were identified. A new atomistic model was developed to correlate these structural characteristics with key magnetic properties such as Curie temperature, saturation magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and their grain-to-grain variation. The model shows good agreement with the experimental magnetic data and explains the gap in magnetic properties between the bulk and nanostructured FePt.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5022781,[]

            Review: Bioengineering strategies to probe T cell mechanobiology
                ","T cells play a major role in adaptive immune response, and T cell dysfunction can lead to the progression of several diseases that are often associated with changes in the mechanical properties of tissues. However, the concept that mechanical forces play a vital role in T cell activation and signaling is relatively new. The endogenous T cell microenvironment is highly complex and dynamic, involving multiple, simultaneous cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. This native complexity has made it a challenge to isolate the effects of mechanical stimuli on T cell activation. In response, researchers have begun developing engineered platforms that recapitulate key aspects of the native microenvironment to dissect these complex interactions in order to gain a better understanding of T cell mechanotransduction. In this review, we first describe some of the unique characteristics of T cells and the mounting research that has shown they are mechanosensitive. We then detail the specific bioengineering strategies that have been used to date to measure and perturb the mechanical forces at play during T cell activation. In addition, we look at engineering strategies that have been used successfully in mechanotransduction studies for other cell types and describe adaptations that may make them suitable for use with T cells. These engineering strategies can be classified as 2D, so-called 2.5D, or 3D culture systems. In the future, findings from this emerging field will lead to an optimization of culture environments for T cell expansion and the development of new T cell immunotherapies for cancer and other immune diseases.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5006599,[]

            FGF-2 inhibits contractile properties of valvular interstitial cell myofibroblasts encapsulated in 3D MMP-degradable hydrogels
                ","Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) are responsible for the maintenance of the extracellular matrix in heart valve leaflets and, in response to injury, activate from a quiescent fibroblast to a wound healing myofibroblast phenotype. Under normal conditions, myofibroblast activation is transient, but the chronic presence of activated VICs can lead to valve diseases, such as fibrotic aortic valve stenosis, for which non-surgical treatments remain elusive. We monitored the porcine VIC response to exogenously delivered fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2; 100 ng/ml), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1; 5 ng/ml), or a combination of the two while cultured within 3D matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable 8-arm 40 kDa poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels that mimic aspects of the aortic valve. Here, we aimed to investigate VIC myofibroblast activation and subsequent contraction or the reparative wound healing response. To this end, VIC morphology, proliferation, gene expression related to the myofibroblast phenotype [alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)] and matrix remodeling [collagens (COL1A1 and COL3) and MMP1], and contraction assays were used to quantify the cell response. Treatment with FGF-2 resulted in increased cellular proliferation while reducing the myofibroblast phenotype, as seen by decreased expression of CTGF and α-SMA, and reduced contraction relative to untreated control, suggesting that FGF-2 encourages a reparative phenotype, even in the presence of TGF-β1. TGF-β1 treatment predictably led to an increased proportion of VICs exhibiting the myofibroblast phenotype, indicated by the presence of α-SMA, increased gene expression indicative of matrix remodeling, and bulk contraction of the hydrogels. Functional contraction assays and biomechanical analyses were performed on VIC encapsulated hydrogels and porcine aortic valve tissue explants to validate these findings.",https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5042430,[]

            Early pathological characterization of murine dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysms
                ","We report here on the early pathology of a well-established murine model of dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Continuous infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) into apolipoprotein E-deficient mice induces the formation of aortic dissection and expansion at some point after implantation of miniosmotic pumps containing AngII. While this model has been studied extensively at a chronic stage, we investigated the early pathology of dissecting AAA formation at multiple scales. Using high-frequency ultrasound, we screened 12-week-old male mice daily for initial formation of these aneurysmal lesions between days 3 and 10 post-implantation. We euthanized animals on the day of diagnosis of a dissecting AAA or at day 10 if no aneurysmal lesion developed. Aortic expansion and reduced vessel wall strain occurred in animals regardless of whether a dissecting AAA developed by day 10. The aortas of mice that did not develop dissecting AAAs showed intermediate changes in morphology and biomechanical properties. RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis revealed multiple proinflammatory and matrix remodeling genes to be upregulated in the suprarenal aorta of AngII-infused mice as compared to saline-infused controls. Histology and immunohistochemistry confirmed that extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammatory cell infiltration, notably neutrophils and macrophages, occurred in AngII-infused mice with and without dissecting AAAs but not saline-infused controls. Understanding early disease processes is a critical step forward in translating experimental results in cardiovascular disease research.
